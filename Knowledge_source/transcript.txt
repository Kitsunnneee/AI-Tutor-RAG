Hello, everybody.
Welcome to this English course.
In today's video, I'm going to tell you about nouns.
Because in English, nouns are very important.
They are the basic element of a sentence.
So if you want to speak English,
you need to know about the different kinds of nouns.
And I'm going to try and teach you as well as I can.
Let's get started!
Ok, so let's start with concrete nouns.
Now in English, concrete nouns are people places or things,
including animals.
That you can see, that you can smell,
or taste, or hear, or touch.
So you can basically use your five senses.
Let me give you a few examples.
If we talk about people,
you could say, a man
or a teacher,
or me, Fanny.
Or Mr. Smith.
If we talk about places,
you could say,
a house, a school.
You could name a city like London.
Very nice city.
Or a beach.
And if you talk about things,
you could say a shoe,
you could say a marker,
you
could talk about a dog
or food like a pizza.
These are concrete nouns....ok.
Now let's move on to abstract nouns.
So abstract nouns, unlike concrete nouns,
are ideas, concepts, emotions.
And you can't see an idea.
You can't smell a concept.
You can't taste an emotion.
Or hear it. Or touch it.
So they are nouns. They are things that exist, but
you cannot see them, or taste them.
You can't use your five sense.
To give you a few examples,
we could talk about love,
or time,
or religion,
rules.
These are all words that represent
ideas, concepts... okay
They're abstract nouns in English.
Now, let's get into more detail about nouns.
Let's now see the difference between common nouns
and proper nouns which are very important in English.
So common nouns and proper nouns
refer to people, places, things, ideas.
Let's see a few examples.
We could talk about people for example.
A woman.
That's a common noun.
But if we talk about a specific woman,
for example, me, Fanny.
That becomes a proper noun with a capital 'F'.
because, and you should know this,
proper nouns are always capitalized.
You could talk about places.
A city. That's a common noun.
But then you can name a specific city.
Let's take a
great city, London, of course.
With a capital 'L'.
Remember proper nouns - always capitalized.
We can talk about things for
example. An animal.
Let's take a dog. A dog.
That's a common noun.
But if we take a specific dog, like Snoopy - capital 'S',
that's the proper noun.
If we talk about things again, but for example, a car,
that's a common noun.
But if we name the brand, the specific brand of the car like Volvo,
that's a proper noun. And it takes a capital 'V'.
And finally, and we can say, a team - common noun.
But if we name a specific team, for example,
the best football team, Manchester United,
then that's a proper noun
and it's capitalized.
Now mind you,
'team', is a special word because it's called
a collective noun in English
because it refers to a group of people.
So collective nouns can be used as
singular nouns or plural nouns.
But we will talk about this again later.
So now that we know a lot about nouns in English,
Let's practice finding nouns in a sentence.
Okay, first,
In my class at Oxford University, I have many friends.
My best friend is Jan.
I have a lot of love for her.
Jan has a cute dog.
Its name is Juju.
What are the nouns in these sentences?
If we take the first sentence,
In my class at Oxford University, I have many friends.
We have, class, and friends.
These are common nouns.
We also have a proper noun, Oxford
University.
We know it's a proper noun because it's capitalized.
The second sentence is,
My best friend is Jen.
Now in this sentence,
the noun is, friend - common noun.
And there's also the word, Jen,
is also a noun but a proper noun.
As you can see it's capitalized.
Then, I have a lot of love for her.
What noun can you see?
Of course, 'love'.
Remember the abstract noun
we talked about a few minutes ago.
And finally, Jan has a cute dog. Its name is Juju.
What nouns can we find?
We can see, 'Jen', again - proper noun.
'Dog' - common noun.
But also, 'name', and 'Juju'.
'Name's' a common noun.
'Juju' is the proper noun.
It's capitalized.
As you probably know,
I haven't mentioned, 'I', or 'her', or 'its'.
They are also nouns, but they are pronouns and
they're considered a different category in English.
We will talk about them in another video .
Great job guys!
Thank you for watching my video.
I hope you now have a better
understanding of nouns in English.
Please keep practicing.
Practice makes perfect.
I'm sure you will very soon be able to
recognize nouns in a sentence.
Please make sure to watch my next video as I keep on talking about nouns.
See you.

Hello guys!
And welcome to this English course on nouns.
In today’s video, we’re going to talk
about singular and plural nouns.
When you speak English, it is very important
to know the difference between a singular
noun and a plural noun.
Ok?
So I will explain to you the different rules.
And we will practice  together.
Let’s get started.
Ok guys, the first you need to know, is that
a singular noun means one.
So, for example, I can say, ‘cat’.
‘a cat’
‘one cat’
‘school’
‘a school’
‘one school’
‘team’
Now don’t forget, ‘team’ is a collective
noun.
It’s a group of people, but still, it is
a singular noun.
We talk about ‘a team’, or ‘one team.
‘lady’
‘monkey’
‘tomato’
‘a tomato’
‘one tomato’
Or ‘piano’.
Now, if we talk about plural nouns, it means
more than one.
So for example, two, three, four, or many.
If we take our words again, ‘a cat’ becomes
‘cats’.
‘two cats’
‘three cats’
‘many cats’
‘school’’ becomes ‘schools’.
‘team’ becomes ‘teams’.
Ok, so you just add an ‘s’.
Now ‘lady’ becomes ‘ladies.
‘monkey’ becomes ‘monkeys’.
But, two different rules.
As you can see,
‘lady’ is consonant + ‘y’.
Now when you have consonant + ‘y’, in
an English word, the plural will be ‘ies’.
‘lady’
‘ladies’
But when you have vowel + ‘y’ like ‘monkey’,
it just becomes ‘monkeys’.
You simply add an ‘s’.
Ok, ‘monkey’ becomes ‘monkeys’.
‘tomato’ becomes ‘tomatoes’.
‘piano’ ‘pianos’
Again, two different rules.
Now ‘tomato’ becomes ‘tomatoes’.
You add ‘es’.
And with most words ending in ‘o’, so
consonant + ‘o’, you will add ‘es’.
But sometimes, you will only add ‘s’.
Like ‘piano’, ‘pianos’.
There is no particular rule for this.
You just need to know the words that only
end with an ‘s’.
Ok, let’s move on to some pronunciation
now.
So, when it comes to pronunciation, we have
three different sounds.
The first sound is /s/.
The second sound is /z/.
And the third sounds is /Iz/.
So let’s review some words together and
be really careful, what sound do you hear?
‘cats’
‘cats’
What can you hear?
/s/
Can you repeat after me.
‘cats’
‘cats’
The second word is ‘schools’.
‘schools’
What sound can you hear?
Of course, /z/.
Repeat after me.
‘schools’
‘schools’
The third words is ‘teams’.
What sound can you hear?
Again, /z/.
Repeat after me.
‘teams’
‘teams’
Then we have ‘ladies’.
‘ladies’
/z/
Repeat after me.
‘ladies’
‘ladies’
Then ‘monkeys’.
/z/ again.
Repeat after me.
‘monkeys’.
‘monkeys’
Then we have ‘tomatoes’.
Again, it’s the /z/ sound.
‘tomatoes’
‘tomatoes’
And finally, ‘pianos’.
/z/
‘pianos’
‘pianos’
Let’s move on to other rules now.
Ok guys, let’s now talk about nouns that
end in ‘s’, ‘sh’, ‘x’, ‘ch’,
or ‘z’.
Now to make the plural form of these nouns,
you will add ‘es’.
And the sound will be /Iz/.
Let’s review some words together.
‘bus’ becomes ‘buses’.
‘bush’ ‘bushes’
‘fox’ ‘foxes’
‘beach’ ‘beaches’
‘quiz’ ‘quizzes’
Can you repeat after me?
‘buses’ ‘buses’
‘bushes’ ‘bushes’
‘foxes’ ‘foxes’
‘beaches’ ‘beaches’
‘quizzes’ ‘quizzes’
Let’s move on.
Ok, guys.
Moving on to nouns that end in ‘f’ or
‘fe’.
For example, ‘roof’ becomes ‘roofs’.
‘safe’ ‘safes’
So you simply add an ‘s’.
Then we have ‘leaf’ that becomes ‘leaves’.
Wait a minute.
What happened?
Well, ya, sometimes in English, a word ending
in ‘f’ becomes a word ending in ‘ves’
in plural.
That’s not a rule.
But some words end in ‘ves’, you just
have to learn them I’m afraid.
Another word, ‘wife’.
And again, ‘ves’.
‘wives’
‘shelf’ ‘shelves’
Again, this ‘ves’ ending.
Now let’s focus on pronunciation.
‘roofs’
So it’s an /s/ sound.
Can you repeat after me?
‘roofs’
‘roofs’
Good job.
‘safes’
‘safes’
Have you heard the /s/ sound?
‘safes’
Then we have ‘leaves’.
And this time it’s a /z/ sound.
Repeat after me.
‘leaves’
‘leaves’
Great.
Moving on.
‘wives’
‘wives’
And finally,
‘shelves’
‘shelves’
Great job guys.
Let’s move on to practice now.
Well students, let’s now practice together.
I’m going to give you a singular noun, and
I want you to try and find the plural form
of this singular noun.
Ok?
Let’s give it a try.
The first word is ‘baby’.
‘baby’
Don’t forget, it ends with consonant + ‘y’.
Do you remember the rule?
It’s ‘babies’ with ‘ies’.
Very nice.
‘baby’ ‘babies’
The second word is ‘toy’.
Hmmm, vowel + ‘y’.
So this time, ‘toys’.
You simply add an ‘s’.
Then we have ‘wish’.
Wish is a word that ends in ‘sh’.
Remember the rule.
‘wishes’
You add ‘es’.
‘taxi’ becomes ‘taxis’.
You simply add an ‘s’.
‘choice’ ‘choices’
Simply add an ‘s’ as well.
Then we have the word ‘wolf’.
Aha!
It’s a word ending in ‘f’.
Is it a word with ‘ves’?
It is.
‘wolves’
And finally,
‘photo’
Now remember the words ending in ‘o’?
You can add ‘es’ or simply ‘s’.
Well with photo, you simply add an ‘s’.
‘photos’
Now if we focus on pronunciation now.
Repeat the words after me.
‘babies’
The sound is /z/
‘babies’
‘toys’
‘toys’
‘wishes’
Remember this /Iz/ sound?
Repeat after me.
‘wishes’
‘taxis’
‘taxis’
‘choices’
‘choices’
‘wolves’
‘wolves’
And finally,
‘photos’ ‘photos’
Excellent job guys.
Now let’s move on to some example sentences.
I have some example sentences for you guys.
Using singular and plural nouns.
I would like you to repeat the sentences after me.
And be really careful to use proper pronunciation.
Let’s get started.
First,
‘I want a dog.’
‘I like dogs.’
Repeat after me, guys.
‘I want a dog.’
‘I like dogs.’
The second sentence.
‘I don’t want a fox.’
‘I don’t like foxes.’
After me, guys.
‘I don’t want a fox.’
‘I don’t like foxes.’
Great, moving on the to the third sentence.
‘I bought a watch.’
‘I have many watches.’
Repeat after me.
‘I bought a watch.’
‘I have many watches.’
Good job.
Sentence four now.
‘I have a new stereo.’
‘Now, I have two stereos.’
After me.
‘I have a new stereo.’
‘Now, I have two stereos.’
Excellent!
And finally,
‘There’s a knife.’
‘There are six knives in the kitchen.’
Repeat after me.
‘There’s a knife.’
‘There are six knives in the kitchen.’
Amazing job guys.
Very nice.
I hoped this has helped.
I hope you now understand better, singular
and plural nouns in English.
Now, I haven’t talked about all the pronunciation
rules,
But I hope you have a good sense now of how
pronounce plural forms.
Make sure you watch my next video if you want

Hello, guys.
Welcome to this English course on nouns.
In today’s video, I’m going to tell you
about irregular plural nouns.
Now there are crazy ways of making plural
forms in English.
And there are a lot of irregular forms.
I want you to know about them, so let’s
get started.
Again, guys, there are so many irregular plural
forms in English.
And I’m afraid there are no particular rules.
You just need to learn the words.
But I’m going to try and tell you about
the most common ones.
Ok?
Let’s review some words together.
Ok, so, for example.
We have a singular noun which is ‘woman’.
It’s plural form is ‘women’.
‘woman’ ‘women’
Then we have ‘man’.
The singular noun, ‘a man’, it becomes
‘men’.
‘a child’ becomes ‘children’
‘a tooth’ ‘teeth’
‘a foot’ becomes ‘feet’
‘a person’ becomes ‘people’.
‘a mouse’ becomes ‘mice’
Ok, let’s move on to pronunciation now.
Well students, let’s work on pronunciation
a bit.
Please repeat after me.
‘woman’ ‘woman’
‘women’ ‘women’
Good.
‘man’ ‘man’
‘men’ ‘men’
‘child’ ‘child’
‘children’ ‘children’
Very good guys.
Moving on.
‘tooth’ ‘tooth’
‘teeth’ ‘teeth’
‘foot’ ‘foot’
‘feet’ ‘feet’
‘person’ ‘person’
‘people’ ‘people’
Very good guys.
And the last one.
‘mouse’ ‘mouse’
‘mice’ ‘mice’
Excellent, guys.
Let’s now move on to other irregular plural
forms.
Now there are words that have the exact same
singular and plural forms.
They are not common, but you need to know
a few.
Let’s take a look together.
As you can see, ‘sheep’ is the singular
form.
But the plural form is not ‘sheeps’.
It is ‘sheep’.
Same goes for ‘deer’ ‘deer’.
‘moose’ ‘moose’
‘fish’ ‘fish’
‘aircraft’ ‘aircraft’
Ok, so you will say, “I see one sheep.”
But also, “I see two sheep.”
The exact same word.
Ok, let’s go back for pronunciation.
I want you to repeat after me.
‘sheep’ ‘sheep’
‘deer’ ‘deer’
‘moose’ ‘moose’
‘fish’ ‘fish’
‘aircraft’ ‘aircraft’
Good job guys.
Let’s move to other irregular forms.
Some nouns are never singular.
We always use their plural forms.
I have a few common ones for you guys.
Let’s have a look.
‘jeans’
‘pants’
‘glasses’
‘sunglasses’
‘clothes’
‘scissors’
‘pajamas’
So you will say, “I have some jeans.”
Or, “I have scissors.”
But you cannot say, “I have a jean.”
It is incorrect in English.
Let’s work a bit on pronunciation.
Repeat after me, please.
‘jeans’ ‘jeans’
‘pants’ ‘pants’
‘glasses’ ‘glasses’
‘sunglasses’ ‘sunglasses’
‘clothes’ ‘clothes’
‘scissors’ ‘scissors’
And finally,
‘pajamas’ ‘pajamas’
Good guys.
Let’s now look at other irregular plural
forms.
Now, just a few words about nouns in English
that have Latin and Greek origins.
Their plural forms are very weird.
It’s a bit complicated, so we’re not going
to into too much detail.
Don’t worry too much about them.
But just a few words that I think you should
know.
First, we have words ending in ‘a’.
Their plural form will end in ‘ae’.
For example,
‘antenna’ becomes ‘antennae’
‘alumna’ ‘alumnae’
Words ending in ‘us’, us, will end in
‘i’.
‘octopus’ ‘octopi’
‘cactus’ ‘cacti’
Words ending in ‘is’, will end in ‘es’.
‘is’ becomes ‘es’.
For example, ‘analysis’ ‘analyses’
‘diagnosis’ ‘diagnoses’
And finally, words ending in ‘on’, end
in ‘a’.
‘criterion’ ‘criteria’
‘phenomenon’ ‘phenomena’
These plural forms are very difficult, guys.
Even native speakers make a lot of mistakes,
so don’t worry too much about them.
I just wanted to give you a little taste of
Latin and Greek plurals.
Let’s move on to example sentences now.
Ok, guys.
I have a few example sentences for you.
It’s a great opportunity to practice saying
irregular plural forms in English.
Be very careful to use proper pronunciation
as well.
Let’s start.
First, ‘my sister has one child’ ‘my
brother has two children’.
Repeat after me.
‘my sister has one child’ ‘my brother
has two children’.
Next.
‘I’m a quiet person, so I don’t talk
to many people.’
Please repeat after me.
‘I’m a quiet person, so I don’t talk
to many people.’
Good guys.
Next sentence.
‘Did you catch one fish or two fish at the
lake?’
Repeat after me, please.
‘Did you catch one fish or two fish at the
lake?’
Very good.
Next sentence.
‘I have one pair of glasses and two pairs
of sunglasses.’
Repeat after me.
‘I have one pair of glasses and two pairs
of sunglasses.’
Excellent, guys.
And finally,
‘He has one cactus in his front yard, but
many cacti in his back yard.’
Repeat after me.
‘He has one cactus in his front yard, but
many cacti in his back yard.’
Ok, students.
I hope you repeated after me.
And you practiced your pronunciation.
I hope you now have a better understanding
of irregular plural forms in English.
There are many of them.
Not many rules to follow.
A lot of words to memorize.
But, I’m sure with a little bit of practice,
you can do it.

Hello guys, welcome back to this English course
on nouns.
In today’s video, I’m going to tell you
about compound nouns.
They are very common in English and there
are thousands of them.
You need to know about them.
Let’s get started.
A compound noun is made up of two different
words.
So you take two words, you put them together,
to create a new noun.
They’re usually quite easy to understand.
For example, ‘full moon’.
‘Full’ is obviously the adjective describing
the moon.
Let’s take a look at other examples, and
how to create compound nouns.
Sometimes, compound nouns are a single noun.
Like, ‘toothpaste’.
Sometimes, they’re two or more words hyphenated.
Such as ‘mother-in-law’.
And sometimes, they’re two separate words,
like ‘ice cream’.
Now, you have to be careful.
Sometimes, you have a simple adjective plus
a noun like ‘a green house’.
But you also have a compound noun which is
a different meaning.
‘A greenhouse’.
Now, ‘a green house’, is a house which
is green.
But the compound noun, ‘a greenhouse’,
is a place where you grow plants.
Completely different meaning.
Ok, so you have to be careful.
Stresses can help.
Usually the stress is on the first syllable
in compound nouns.
Ok, I hope you get it guys.
Let’s take a closer look now at compound
nouns.
Ok, let’s now take a look at the parts of
speech that make up a compound noun.
We can have a noun and another noun.
Like, ‘bedroom’.
We can also have a noun and a verb.
Like, ‘haircut’.
A noun and a preposition.
Like, ‘passer-by’.
A verb and a noun.
Like, ‘washing machine’.
A verb and a preposition.
Like, ‘drawback’.
A preposition and a noun.
Like, ‘underground’.
An adjective and a ver.
Like, ‘dry-cleaning’.
An adjective and a noun.
Like, ‘software’.
Or a preposition and a verb.
Like, ‘input’.
As you can see guys, there are so many ways
to create compound nouns with different words.
Now let’s get back to our example for pronunciation.
Please repeat after me.
Bedroom
Bedroom
Haircut
Haircut
Passer-by
Passer-by
Washing machine
Washing machine
Drawback
Drawback
Underground
Underground
Dry-cleaning
Dry-cleaning
Software
Software
Input
Input
Good job guys.
Now let’s now move on to plural compound
nouns.
So when we want to make compound nouns plural,
there are rules to follow.
If you have a single word, you simply add
an ‘s’.
But if you have separate words, whether hyphenated
or not, you will make the most significant
word plural.
Let’s take a look at examples.
‘Newspaper’ will simply be ‘newspapers’.
So I have man newspapers.
Swimming pool.
Now, what’s the most significant word?
Well, it is ‘pool’.
So we will say, ‘there are two swimming
pools’.
You cannot say, ‘there are two swimmings
pools.’
No ‘s’ at swimming.
Brother-in-law
What’s the most significant word?
Well of course, it is ‘brother’.
So you will say, “I have two brothers-in-law”.
And finally, ‘woman doctor’.
Now, what’s the most significant word?
Actually, both words are significant.
So we will both make them plural.
Remember, the plural form of ‘woman’ is
‘women’.
So we will say, “Four women doctors work
at the hospital”.
Let’s work on pronunciation.
Can you repeat after me, please.
I have man newspapers.
I have man newspapers.
There are two swimming pools.
There are two swimming pools.
I have two brothers-in-law.
I have two brothers-in-law.
And finally,
Four women doctors work at the hospital.
Four women doctors work at the hospital.
Good job guys.
Now let’s move on to practice.
To practice, I have a few sentences.
And I want you to tell me if we are using
compound nouns or not.
Let’s take a look.
I want to drink some cold water.
Is ‘cold water’ a compound noun?
What do you think?
It isn’t.
‘Cold’ is a simply adjective describing
the water.
She has a new boy friend.
Is boy friend a compound noun?
Well, it isn’t in this case.
He’s your friend and he’s a boy.
But the compound noun, ‘boyfriend’, in
one word, exists and has a different meaning.
Then, your boyfriend is more than a friend.
He’s the boy you’re having a relationship
with.
Other example.
The blue bird was singing in the tree.
Is ‘blue bird’ a compound noun?
Not in this case.
It’s a simple bird and it’s blue.
But, the compound noun, ‘bluebird’, in
one word, exists.
It’s a specific bird.
Let’s meet at the bus stop.
Is ‘bus stop’ a compound noun?
What do you think?
It is.
I have two alarms clock.
What about ‘alarms clock’?
Well, it is a compound noun, but there is
a big mistake.
Can you see it?
Of course, the plural form.
The plural form is not ‘alarms clock’.
But, ‘alarm clocks’.
Because the most significant word is ‘clock’.
Ok guys, let’s move on.
Thank you for watching.
I hope you better understand compound nouns
and how to create them.
There are so many compound nouns in the English
language, but they are usually very easy to
understand.
And if you’re not sure, look it up in a
dictionary.
The dictionary will tell you if it’s a compound
noun or not.
Thank you for watching guys.
And see you in the next videos.

Hello, guys.
Welcome back to this English course on nouns.
In this video, I’m going to tell you about
countable and uncountable nouns.
It’s very important to know the difference
between countable and uncountable nouns in
English.
And students often get confused.
So please listen to me very carefully.
Let’s get started.
Countable nouns are nouns that you can count.
Uncountable nouns are nouns that you cannot count.
They’re usually a type or a group.
And they’re always singular.
Let’s look at a few examples.
Countable nouns – you can say, “a dog.”
You can say, “one dog,” “two dogs,”
“three dogs,” and so on.
“Man.”
You can say, “a man.”
“Two men.”
“Idea.”
You can say, “one idea,” “two ideas,”
and so on.
“Computer.”
Again, you can say, “one computer, two computers.”
And, “house.”
Well, you can say, “one house, two houses,
three houses,” and so on.
These are countable nouns.
You can count them.
But if we look at uncountable nouns.
When you say, “water.”
You can’t say, “One water, two waters.”
It doesn’t make any sense.
You cannot count water.
Same goes for air.
You can’t say, “one air, two airs.”
It’s just ‘air’.
It’s uncountable.
‘traffic’
‘English’
‘Equipment’
These are all uncountable nouns.
You cannot count them
And they’re always singular.
Okay, guys.
Now, let’s take a closer look at rules with
countable nouns and uncountable nouns.
So how do we know if a word is countable or uncountable?
Well there are a few tricks that can help.
Let’s look at these words.
Some groups of words are very often uncountable.
And this can help you.
For example, liquids.
Water, juice, milk, beer.
All those words are uncountable.
Powders.
Sugar, flour, salt, rice.
Uncountable words as well.
Materials.
Such as wood, plastic, metal, or paper.
Food as well.
Like fruit, meat, cheese, and bread.
And finally, abstract ideas.
Like time, information, love, and beauty.
Another trick is that most of the time, you
can measure uncountable nouns.
Let’s look at examples.
For example, if we take liquids.
I have two liters of milk.
Now, you cannot count milk.
But you can measure milk.
And you can count liters.
So you can say, “I have two liters of milk.”
You can say, “I have a glass of water.”
Or “I have glasses of water.”
“Cups of coffee.”
“Bottles of water.”
So you can measure this uncountable noun.
Same goes with powders.
“I have one kilogram of sugar.”
“Two kilograms of sugar.”
With materials and foods, we often use the
word, ‘piece’.
For example, “I ate two pieces of cake.”
Or bread.
Or pizza.
Or meat.
Or cheese.
“I need pieces of paper.”
Wood.
Plastic.
Metal.
Or “I have some water.”
‘Some’ is an article that always works
with uncountable nouns.
Ok guys, I hope you understand.
Let’s move on.
Some words can be both countable and uncountable nouns.
Now not all of them.
But some of them.
Let’s take a look.
“I would like to eat some cake.”
“I would like two pieces of cake.”
So in these two sentences, ‘cake’ is obviously
and uncountable noun.
But if I say, “I would like to eat two cakes.”
Suddenly, it becomes a countable noun.
Why?
Because in the first two sentences, we are
talking about pieces of one cake.
In the last sentence, we are considering the
whole cake.
So it becomes countable.
Another example.
“I would like to eat some chicken.”
“I would like to eat a piece of chicken.”
Both sentences, uncountable noun, ‘chicken’.
But the last sentence, “I see two chickens.”
Hmm, ‘chicken’, in this case, is a countable
noun.
Why?
Because in the first two sentences, ‘chicken’
is food.
But in the last sentence, ‘chicken’ is
an animal.
So the animal is a countable noun.
‘Chicken’ as food is uncountable.
Hope you get it.
Let’s move on to example sentences now.
Let’s now review a few example sentences,
so you can practice using countable and uncountable
nouns.
Please repeat after me.
And be careful to use proper pronunciation.
Let’s get started.
First sentence guys.
“I put one hundred candles on six cakes.”
Please repeat after me.
“I put one hundred candles on six cakes.”
“I put one hundred candles on six cakes.”
Good job.
Second example.
“I ate two pieces of cake.”
Please repeat after me.
“I ate two pieces of cake.”
“I ate two pieces of cake.”
Next sentence.
“I saw some trash on all the streets.”
Please repeat after me.
“I saw some trash on all the streets.”
“I saw some trash on all the streets.”
Very good.
Next one.
“I need to buy some milk and some butter
from the market.”
Please repeat after me.
“I need to buy some milk and some butter
from the market.”
“I need to buy some milk and some butter
from the market.”
And finally.
“Traffic and pollution are problems in many
cities.”
Repeat after me.
“Traffic and pollution are problems in many
cities.”
“Traffic and pollution are problems in many
cities.”
Good job guys.
I hope you repeated after me and worked on
your pronunciation.
Thank you for watching this video.
I hope you now have a better understanding
of countable and uncountable nouns.
I know it’s hard, but don’t worry, keep
practicing.
Practice makes perfect.

Countable nouns are nouns that you can count.
Ok, so for example, if you say ‘a dog’,
you can say, “a dog, one dog, two dogs,
three dogs.”
You can count them.
Uncountable nouns…
Stop, you gotta slow down.
Ahh, sorry.
Why am I going so fast?
Slow down.
Take your time.
Make it a good video.
Okay.
Countable nouns are nouns that you can count.

Hello, guys.
And welcome to this English course on adjectives.
In today’s video, I’m going to tell you
everything there is to know about adjectives.
And what they are exactly.
The best way to describe an adjective in English
is to say that
it’s a word that describes or clarifies a noun.
It gives you information on people, things,
ideas, nouns, or pronouns.
It is very important to understand what adjectives are
and to know how to use them.
Because they are essential when you speak English.
Let’s get started.
Adjectives give us so much information about nouns.
Let’s, for example, take a common noun, ‘cup’.
And see how many ways there are in English
to describe a cup
using different kinds of adjectives.
Let’s see.
We can say, “It’s a great cup.”
Just give your opinion.
“It’s a big cup.”
Talking about the size of the cup.
If you want to talk about the shape of the
cup you could say,
“It’s a round cup.”
“It’s an old cup.”
If you want to talk about age.
Or if you want to say what color it is,
“It’s a white cup.”
Or talking about temperature,
“It’s a cold cup.”
“It’s a broken cup.”
If you make observations.
“It’s a Korean cup.”
Talking about origins.
Or you can mention the material.
“It’s a plastic cup.”
Or “It’s a coffee cup.”
Talking about the purpose of the cup.
Now ‘coffee’ as you know is a noun.
But in this case, it can be used as an adjective.
All these adjectives are places before the
noun.
Let’s learn more about adjectives.
Adjectives can found before the noun.
It’s called the attribute position.
Or after the noun.
Which is called the predicative position.
And it’s just as common.
Adjectives which are found after a verb, describe
the subject of this verb.
Usually a noun or a pronoun.
So if we take the sentence,
“The girl is nice.”
The adjective, ‘nice’, refers to the subject
of the sentence, ‘the girl’.
But it is placed after the verb ‘to be’.
“My students are happy.”
Same thing.
The adjective, ‘happy’, describes the
subject of the sentence, ‘my students’.
But it is placed after the verb.
I hope you understand guys.
Let’s move on to practice now.
Let’s now practice finding adjectives in
a few sentences.
“I’m a tall woman.”
Can you see the adjective in this sentence?
I hope you can.
The adjective is ‘tall’.
It gives you the height of the woman.
“I’m a British woman.”
Now where is the adjective?
The adjective is ‘British’.
Gives you the origins of this woman.
“I have blonde hair.”
Now what’s the adjective in this sentence?
Of course guys, it is ‘blonde’.
It gives you the color of the hair.
“My eyes are blue.”
Now that’s a different sentence.
Can you spot the adjective?
The adjective is ‘blue.
What’s blue?
My eyes.
‘My eyes’ is the subject of the sentence
and the adjective is ‘blue’.
“I’m nice.”
Again, can you spot the adjective?
It’s ‘nice’.
Okay?
And finally,
“The weather is cold.”
What’s the adjective?
Where is it?
Can you see it?
The adjective is ‘cold’.
What’s cold?
The weather.
‘The weather’ is the subject and the adjective
is ‘cold’.
Now in the first three sentences, it’s the
attribute position.
Remember?
The adjective comes before the noun.
And in the last three sentences, it’s the
predicative position.
Remember?
The adjective comes after the noun.
And in this case, after the verb ‘to be’.
I hope you understand this.
Good job.
Okay, guys.
Let’s go through the sentences again.
This time focusing on pronunciation.
It’s very important that you repeat the
sentences after me
to practice saying these adjectives in a sentence.
Okay, let’s get started.
“I’m a tall woman.”
Can you repeat after me?
Twice.
First, “I’m a tall woman.”
“I’m a tall woman.”
Very good.
Moving on.
“I’m a British woman.”
Repeat after me.
“I’m a British woman.”
“I’m a British woman.”
Good.
Third sentence
“I have blonde hair.”
So repeat after me please.
“I have blonde hair.”
“I have blonde hair.”
Very good.
“My eyes are blue.”
Repeat after me.
“My eyes are blue.”
“My eyes are blue.”
Next one.
“I’m nice.”
Repeat after me.
“I’m nice.”
“I’m nice.”
Good job.
And finally,
“The weather is cold.”
Please repeat.
“The weather is cold.”
“The weather is cold.”
Excellent job, guys.
Ok, guys.
Thank you for watching this video.
I hope you now understand what adjectives are
and how to use them in English.

continue talking about adjectives.

Hello, guys.
Welcome to this English course on adjectives.
In today’s video, I’m going to talk about
prefixes and suffixes that are commonly added
to adjectives in English.
A prefix is a few letters added to a beginning
of a word to change the meaning of that word.
And a suffix is a few letters added to the
end of the word to change the meaning.
We’ll get more into detail.
Let’s get started.
Let’s take a look at a few adjectives with
prefixes.
Again a ‘prefix’ is a few letters added
to the beginning of the adjective.
Mostly to make it negative.
Let’s take a look at a few examples.
First we have the prefix ‘un’. U, n.
For example, if we take the word, ‘fair’,
and want to make it negative, we can add u
– n to have the word ‘unfair’ which
is the opposite of fair.
Same goes for ‘happy’.
‘unhappy’
‘sure’ become ‘unsure’.
Another prefix is i –n , ‘in’.
To make the adjective negative, again,
For example, ‘active’ – ‘inactive’.
‘appropriate’
’inappropriate’
‘complete’
‘incomplete’
The prefix i –r now, ‘ir’.
For example,
‘responsible’
‘irresponsible’
‘regular’
‘irregular’
‘rational’
‘irrational’
Then we have the prefix i –m, ‘im’.
For example,
‘balance’
‘imbalance’
‘polite’
‘impolite’
‘possible’
‘impossible’
And finally, the prefix, ‘il’.
I – l.
Like, ‘legal’
‘illegal’
‘literate’
‘illiterate’
‘logical’
‘illogical’
These are just a few examples, guys.
There are so many other prefixes in English.
But I hope you now have a better understanding.
Let’s move on.
Let’s now talk about suffixes.
In English, you can add a few letters to a
noun or a verb to make it into an adjective.
Not necessarily a negative adjective.
It’s not like prefixes.
There are so many suffixes in English, but
here is a list of very common ones.
We can find a suffix ‘able’.
Like, ‘adorable’.
‘comfortable’
Also the suffix ‘en’, e – n.
Like, ‘broken’.
‘golden’
‘ese’
Like, ‘Chinese’.
‘Japanese’
‘ful’
Like, ‘wonderful’.
‘powerful’
‘ative’
Like, ‘informative’.
‘talkative’
‘ous’
‘dangerous’
‘enormous’
Or ‘some’.
Like, ‘awesome’.
‘handsome’
Again, these are just a few examples.
There are so many suffixes.
But I hope you now have a good idea of how
to use suffixes in English.
Let’s now move on to practice.
Okay, guys.
Let’s practice finding adjectives in the
following sentences.
And prefixes or suffixes.
Let’s have a look.
“I have an uncomfortable seat.”
Now, can you spot the adjective, first?
Of course, the adjective here is ‘uncomfortable’.
Can you see any prefix or suffix?
I do.
There is a prefix, which is ‘un’.
And there is a suffix as well.
The suffix, ‘able’.
Okay, so look at how we transformed the word.
The first word was ‘comfort’ in English.
First, we added a suffix to make it into an
adjective, which is ‘comfortable’.
And then we added a prefix, ‘un’, to make
it negative.
So the seat is not comfortable, it is uncomfortable.
That’s how prefixes and suffixes can be
used in English.
The second sentence, “She has a black car.”
Can you spot the adjective, first.
Of course, it’s the adjective ‘black’.
Is there a suffix or a prefix?
No, there isn’t.
Next sentence.
“His father was unhelpful.”
What’s the adjective?
‘unhelpful’
Of course.
Any prefix, suffix?
Yes, there is a prefix.
Again, which is ‘un’.
To make the adjective negative.
And there is a suffix, ‘ful’.
To make the noun ‘help’ into an adjective.
‘unhelpful’
Next sentence.
“The actor is handsome.”
The adjective, of course, is ‘handsome’.
Is there a prefix?
No, there isn’t.
Is there a suffix?
Of course, ‘some’.
‘handsome’
“I hate oily food.”
The adjective is ‘oily’.
Of course.
Is there a prefix?
There isn’t.
Is there a suffix?
Of course.
The ‘y’ is a suffix.
You have the word, the noun, ‘oil’.
And to make it into an adjective you add the
suffix ‘y’.
And finally,
“She is a dishonest woman.”
The adjective is ‘dishonest’, of course.
Do you have a prefix?
We do. Yes.
We have the prefix, ‘dis’.
It shows this woman is not honest, she is
dishonest.
Okay, so that’s how with prefixes and suffixes
we can really transform words in English.
It’s wonderful isn’t it?
There are thousands of prefixes and suffixes.
Again, these are just a few examples.
But I hope you now understand how it works
in English and how you can really transform
and play with the different words and kinds
of words.
Okay, guys. Let’s now review the sentences
together and focus on pronunciation.
Repeat after me, please.
“I have an uncomfortable seat.”
“I have an uncomfortable seat.”
Good job.
Second sentence.
“She has a black car.”
“She has a black car.”
Good.
Keep repeating.
“His father was unhelpful.”
“His father was unhelpful.”
“The actor is handsome.”
“The actor is handsome.”
Good.
Moving on.
“I hate oily food.”
“I hate oily food.”
And finally.
“She is a dishonest woman.”
“She is a dishonest woman.”
Excellent guys.
Okay, guys.
Thank you for watching this video.
I hoped this helped you understand a bit more
about prefixes and suffixes in English.
Keep practicing.
It takes practice to get better identifying
prefixes and suffixes, but I’m sure you
can do it.
Make sure you watch the video as I continue
talking about adjectives in English.
Thank you.

Hello guys and welcome to this English course
on adjectives.
In this video, I will be talking to you about
adjectives ending in ‘ed’ or ‘ing’.
These adjectives are very common in English
and they often confuse students and learners
in general.
So please be really careful.
Listen very carefully.
Repeat after me.
Try and understand what the difference is.
Let's get started
Adjectives ending in ‘ed’, describe a
person's feeling.
For example, ‘bored’.
‘I am bored.’
Adjectives ending in ‘ing’ describe a
situation or an event.
For example, ‘boring’.
Let's take a sentence.
‘This film is boring.’
Ok that's the event.
It's boring.
And because the film is boring, I am bored.
That's my feeling.
I hope you get it.
Let's get a few more common examples.
For example, ‘annoyed’ and ‘annoying’.
‘He is annoyed’.
That's a feeling.
‘The noise is annoying’.
You're now describing the noise.
Other example, ‘confused’, ‘confusing’.
‘The student was confused’.
‘The English was confusing’.
‘depressed’
‘depressing’
‘My mom was depressed’.
‘She watched a depressing TV drama’.
‘excited’
‘exciting’
‘I'm excited.’
‘Travelling is exciting.’
‘frustrated’
‘frustrating’
‘My dog is frustrated.’
‘Staying home all day is frustrating.’
‘frightened’
‘frightening’
‘My little sister is frightened of the dark.’
‘A dark room is frightening.’
‘satisfied’
‘satisfying’
‘My dad is satisfied.’
‘He has a satisfying job’.
‘shocked’
‘shocking’
‘We were shocked by the accident.’
‘It was a shocking accident’.
‘interested’
‘interesting’
‘I'm interested in articles.’
‘I'm reading an interesting article’.
Last example, two sentences, two different
meanings.
Look at these:
‘The teacher was bored.’
‘The teacher was boring.’
Now you really have to understand the difference
between those two
because the meaning is not the same at all.
When you say ‘the teacher was bored’,
you are describing the teacher’s feeling.
Okay, that's how the teacher felt at that
time.
He or she was bored.
But when you say ‘the teacher was boring’,
you are describing the teacher.
Okay, the teacher made the students feel bored
because he or she was boring.
Okay, so remember ‘ed’ is for feelings.
And ‘ing’ is to describe events, things,
situations.
Okay let's move on to practice now.
I now have a few example sentences for you.
Let's have a look together.
‘Wow I am excited or exciting about my new
car’
Now what’s the correct answer?
What do you think?
Now remember ‘ed’ to talk about feelings.
‘ing’ to describe things.
In this case, are you talking about your feelings
or are you describing your new car.
Of course you are talking about your feelings.
So ‘Wow I'm excited about my new car.’
Second example:
‘Try not to get bored or boring when you
study English.’
Now what do you think are you talking about
feelings are you describing things?
Of course, again, we're talking about feelings
in this sentence.
‘Try not to get bored when you study English.’
Then, ‘Math is confused or confusing to
me.’?
Do you know the answer?
You are describing math to you.
It is confusing to you.
So math is confusing to me.
‘It was a thrilled or thrilling rollercoaster
ride.’?
Now in this case, if you think for a minute,
can a roller-coaster ride feel anything?
No it can't.
So it's obviously a description.
It was a thrilling rollercoaster ride.
And finally:
‘My mother is disappointed or disappointing
in my English score’.?
Of course you are talking about your mother's
feeling.
She is disappointed in your English score.
Very well guys.
I hope you did well and I hope you understand
the difference between ‘ed’ adjectives
and ‘ing’ adjectives.
Let's now review the sentences together and
focus on pronunciation.
Now listen very carefully and repeat after
me please.
‘Wow, I am excited about my new car.’
‘Wow, I am excited about my new car.’
Good.
‘Try not to get bored when you study English.’
‘Try not to get bored when you study English.’
Good guys.
Third sentence.
‘Math is confusing to me.’
‘Math is confusing to me.’
Very good.
‘It was a thrilling roller coaster ride.’
‘It was a thrilling roller coaster ride.’
Very nice.
And finally:
‘My mother is disappointed in my English
score.’
One last time.
‘My mother is disappointed in my English
score.’
Good job guys.
Okay students.
Thank you for watching.
I hope you understood the difference between
adjectives ending in ‘ed’ and ‘ing’.
They are very important as they will allow
you to describe how you feel and to
describe things and events and situations.
Please keep practicing as this is still a
common mistakes among students.
So the more you practice, the better you'll
get.
Thank you very much.

Hello guys and welcome to this English
course on adjectives.
In this video, I'm gonna talk to you about adjectives order
in a sentence using more than one
adjective to modify a noun.
Now this is a very important topic
because if you use more than one
adjective to modify a noun,
you have to follow a specific order, so you need to keep watching.
Let's get started.
Let's take a look at this
adjective order.
It looks like a lot at first, but you will learn very fast and practice will help.
Let's have a look together.
First, we will use the adjectives describing quality or giving your opinion.
Like delicious, beautiful, or good.
Then, we will talk about size.
Adjectives like tall, short, big.
Then comes age.
Like old, young, new, twenty-year-old.
Then comes shape. Adjectives like
round, or square.
Then color - red, green, blue.
Origin - like Korean, Mexican, or
American.
Material - like glass, gold, or wooden.
And finally, purpose adjectives
like sport or coffee.
Remember my cup from the first video?
Well we could say -
it's a great big old round white Korean plastic cup.
So a great - giving my opinion.
big - the size.
old - the age.
round - for the shape .
white -  the color.
Korean - for the
origins.
plastic - the material.
That's the adjective order. I cannot break it. I have to follow it.
Don't worry guys.
Most of the time you will only use one maybe two or three adjectives in one sentence.
But still you have to follow this order.
Let's now look together at a few sentences with multiple adjectives.
For example, these beautiful young girls went to school.
First, how many adjectives do you see in that sentence?
I see two adjectives beautiful and young.
The order is beautiful - your opinion.
And then, 'young' for age.
Second example.
I have dirty old running shoes.
How many adjectives can you see?
There are three.
Dirty - your opinion.
Old -the age
And running - which is a purpose
adjectives.
Then we have - that's a hot green Korean pepper.
How many adjectives?
There are three adjectives.
Hot - your opinion.
Green - the colour.
Korean - the origins.
And finally, Canada is a nice large country.
Two adjectives.
Nice - for your opinion.
And large - for the size.
Let's now review the
sentences together for pronunciation.
Please repeat after me.
These beautiful young girls went to school.
These beautiful young girls went to school.
I have dirty old running shoes.
I have dirty old running shoes.
Good.
That's a hot green Korean pepper.
That's a hot green Korean pepper.
Very nice. And finally,
Canada is a nice large country.
Canada is a nice large country.
Good job guys.
Let's now move on to more practice.
Okay guys you are experts now.
Time to move on to some extra practice.
I have sentences for you - some of them
are correct - some of them are not.
And it's up to you to tell me.
Let's have a look.
She is a tall British woman.
Now how many adjectives can you see in
this sentence?
I see two adjectives.
And is the order correct?
Tall - is the size.
British - the origins.
So it is correct. Yes.
Size comes before origins.
She is a tall British woman.
I have a red big ball.
How many adjectives?
Two.
And is the order correct?
Red is the color
and big is the size.
Well no it isn't.
It should be - I have a big red ball.
Size comes before color.
I got a gold new watch.
Again, I suppose you know - two adjectives.
Gold for the material.
and new for the age.
And age comes before material so it should be
I got a new gold watch.
My mother has red long hair.
We have two adjectives.
Red for the colour.
And long - the size.
And size comes before color so it should be,
My mother has a long red hair.
And finally,
this is a cute little white puppy.
Three adjectives.
Is the order correct?
what do you think?
Well it is correct.
We have 'cute' for your opinion. '
'little' for the size.
'white' for the color.
And the order is correct.
This is a cute little white puppy
Okay guys.
Thank you for watching this video.
I hope this helped you understand adjective order.
This is not that difficult.
My students learn this order very quickly and I'm sure you will, too.
That's it for this video. I hope to see you in the next one. Bye.

Hello students and welcome back to my
English course on adjectives.
In this video, I'm going to talk to you about
intensifiers and mitigators.
Now what are those?
Don't be scared of by their names.
Intensifiers are simply words that will make
adjectives stronger.
They will give adjectives more power or more
emphasis.
For example, two very common intensifiers
in English are ‘really’ and ‘very’.
Mitigators on the other hand, make the adjectives
weaker like the words b'rather' or fairly'.
But we're gonna go into a little more detail.
Keep watching.
Let's start with intensifiers.
And I have a list of intensifies for you.
Of course these are not all of them, but it's
a good start because they are very common
in English.
Let's have a look.
really
This video is really interesting.
The adjectives in this sentence is 'interesting'
and we make it stronger with the intensifier,
‘really’.
It's really interesting.
very
For example, I'm very happy to learn English.
The adjective is ‘happy’.
And we give it more power with the intensifier.
very
I am very happy to learn English.
Other intensifiers include absolutely.
For example, 'Your new dress is absolutely amazing'.
‘extremely’
Like
‘It's extremely cold outside.”
‘incredibly’
For example, ‘Your son is incredibly smart.’
‘completely’
‘My wallet is completely empty.’
unusually
‘The classroom was unusually quiet.’
And finally, ‘enough’.
‘He isn't old enough to drive.’
Now for this last sentence, the adjective
is old and II intensifier is enough.
It's a special case because as you can hear
and see, ‘enough’ always comes after the
adjective.
Intensifiers are commonly used with comparative
and superlative adjectives.
For example, with comparative adjectives,
we often use 'much'.
For example, ‘He runs much faster than me.’
‘Faster’ is the comparative form of the
adjective ‘fast’.
And to intensify the comparison, we use the
intensifier ‘much’.
So he runs much faster than me.
We also use ‘a lot’.
For example, ‘This red bag is a lot heavier
than this white bag’.
‘heavier’ is the comparative form of the
adjective ‘heavy’.
And we make it even more powerful with ‘a
lot heavier’.
And we also use ‘far’.
For example, ‘She is far taller than me’.
‘taller’ is the comparative of ‘tall’.
We make it more powerful with ‘far’.
‘Far taller than me’.
Now with superlative adjectives, we can use ‘easily’.
For example, ‘This is easily the best restaurant in town’.
‘best’ is the superlative form of the adjective ‘good’.
And we make it even more powerful by saying,
‘easily the best restaurant’.
And we also use ‘by far’.
For example,
‘Sarah is by far the smartest girl in class’.
Let's move on to mitigators.
Now mitigators are the opposite of intensifiers.
They weaken the adjectives.
Let's look at a few examples.
Mitigators include ‘fairly’.
For example, ‘It's fairly sunny today’.
The adjective ‘sunny’ is weakened by the
mitigator ‘fairly’.
So it's not sunny.
It's a bit less than sunny.
Other mitigator, ‘rather’.
So when I say, ‘I'm rather tired’,
I'm not exactly tired.
I'm a bit less.
The adjective is less powerful because of
this ‘rather’.
Other example, ‘pretty’.
‘It's pretty expensive’.
Which means it's not expensive.
It's a little bit less.
Or 'quite'.
Like, ‘The movie was quite good’.
The adjective ‘good’ is less powerful
because of this ‘quite’.
Now be very careful because if you use ‘quite’
with an extreme adjective such as ‘terrible’,
‘perfect’, ‘enormous’, or ‘excellent’
quite means ‘absolutely’.
It becomes an intensifier.
For example, ‘She is quite gorgeous.’
Means she is absolutely gorgeous.
It's more powerful because of the intensified ‘quite’.
So be very careful when you use ‘quite’
because depending on the adjective that you
choose, it has a different meaning.
And it can be either an intensifier or a mitigator.
Let's move on.
Just as intensifiers, mitigators can be used
with comparative adjectives.
Let's look at a few examples.
We can use ‘a bit’.
For example, ‘He's a bit faster than me’.
When you say, “He's a bit faster than me,”
it's less powerful than “He's faster than me.”
So ‘a bit’ mitigates.
It weakens ‘faster’.
Same goes for ‘rather’.
For example,
‘This dress is rather nicer than that dress’.
It weakens the comparison - the nicer.
And finally we can say, ‘slightly’.
For example,
‘My car is slightly older than your car’.
So it's just a little bit older than your car.
It's weak because of this mitigator.
Let's now move on to practice.
I want things to be very clear so I have a
few example sentences for you guys.
And I want you to tell me if you see an intensifier
or a mitigator.
Let's have a look.
First, ‘It's a very interesting game’.
Now what's the adjective in that sentence?
‘interesting’ of course.
What about ‘very’.
Is it an intensifier or a mitigator?
What do you think?
It's an intensifier of course.
It's a very interesting game.
It's more powerful thanks to this ‘very’.
The second sentence,
‘She cooks fairly good pasta’.
Now the adjective in this sentence is ‘good’.
I'm sure you know.
What about ‘fairly’?
Is it an intensifier or a mitigator?
It's a mitigator guys.
The adjective ‘good’ is less powerful
because of ‘fairly’.
‘She cooks fairly good pasta’.
The third example,
‘He's quite brilliant at speaking English’.
The adjective is ‘brilliant’.
Now just a hint.
It's an extreme adjective.
‘brilliant’ is a very strong adjective,
so what about ‘quite’?
Is it an intensifier or a mitigator?
It is an intensifier of course because the
adjective is extreme.
I hope you got that.
Next example.
‘She's a bit younger than I am’.
The adjective is actually a comparative adjective
in this sentence.
‘younger’
'a bit' acts as a mitigator of course.
And finally,
‘My dog is much fatter than my cat’.
Again, it's a comparative adjective - ‘fatter’.
And what about ‘much’?
What do you think?
Intensifier, mitigator?
It's an intensifier.
It's much fatter than my cat.
Good job guys.
Let's move on.
Let's go through the sentences again and focus
on pronunciation.
Please repeat after me.
It's a very interesting game.
One more time.
It's a very interesting game.
Good.
Second example.
She cooks fairly good pasta.
She cooks fairly good pasta.
Third example guys.
He's quite brilliant at speaking English.
One more time.
He's quite brilliant at speaking English.
Moving on.
She's a bit younger than I am.
She's a bit younger than I am.
And finally,
my dog is much fatter than my cat.
My dog is much fatter than my cat.
Excellent guys.
Thank you guys for watching the video.
I hope this has helped.
Now using intensifiers and mitigators takes practice.
A lot of practice.
But I'm sure you can do it and it's worth it.
It will make a true difference to your speaking skills.

Hello, everyone.
Welcome to this English course on adverbs.
And in this video we're gonna talk about adverbs.
Now the simplest definition of an adverb
is that it's a word that describes or modifies a verb.
Now actually adverbs can modify
other parts of the sentence like other adverbs.
But in this video,
we will focus on verbs
and four kinds of adverbs.
Adverbs of time.
Adverbs of place.
Of Manner
and Adverbs of Degree.
Usually they will answer the following questions
about the verbs:
When?
Where?
How?
and To what extent?
Let's look at these sentences.
"The boy ran."
And then we have,
"The boy ran excitedly."
Now this example shows the power of adverbs.
In the second sentence you find out how the boy ran.
In the first sentence
you don't have any information on how the boy ran.
So in the second sentence,
we find out that the boy was very excited.
So it's very important to understand adverbs
and understand how to use them
because they will make you speak English a lot better.
So let's get started.
First let's talk about the position of an adverb.
So where do we put the adverb in the sentence?
Now that is a bit tricky
because the adverb in an English sentence
can be in different parts of the sentence.
Let's look at a few examples:
She climbed the mountain slowly.
Slowly she climbed the mountain.
She slowly climbed the mountain.
Can you guess which word is the adverb?
The word 'slowly' is the adverb.
It describes how she climbed the mountain.
And as you can see,
the adverb is in three different parts
of the sentence but the meaning is exactly the same.
So let's practice pronunciation.
Repeat after me please.
She climbed the mountain slowly.
Slowly she climbed the mountain.
She slowly climbed the mountain.
Great guys. let's move on.
Let's now talk about how to make adverbs.
Now most adverbs, not all of them,
but most of them end in -ly.
So it's actually very easy.
You take the adjective and you add 'ly' at the end.
Let's look at a few examples.
If you have the adjective 'nice',
and you add 'ly' to it,
you make the adverb 'nicely'.
So for example you could say,
"He is a nice speaker" using the adjective 'nice'.
But you could also use the adverb 'nicely' and say,
"He speaks nicely."
A second example -
If we take the adjective 'quick',
and we add 'ly',
we can make the adverb 'quickly'.
So we could say,
"He is a quick runner."
But we could also say,
"He runs quickly."
Okay. Let's practice pronunciation.
Repeat after me please.
"He speaks nicely."
"He runs quickly."
Good job guys.
Let's move on.
Be careful guys.
Not all adverbs end in 'ly'.
Some adjectives don't change form
when they become adverbs.
They're called flat adverbs.
Typical flat adverbs
would be 'early' or 'late' and a few others.
And it's very important to know these flat adverbs.
Because a lot of my students
try to add 'ly' to some adjectives
and unfortunately they make incorrect sentences.
So let's take a look at an example.
Okay. If I tell you
"The car drove fastly"
Do you think that makes sense?
Now it does make sense to try to add 'ly'
to the adjective 'fast',
but unfortunately guys 'fastly' does not exist in English.
So the correct sentence is, "The car drove fast."
Another example,
"He arrived 'late' or 'lately' to class."
What do you think's the correct answer?
Again, it makes sense to try to add 'ly' to the adjective 'late',
but 'lately' is not the adverb of the adjective 'late'.
The adverb is 'late'.
So the correct sentence is, "He arrived late to class."
Let's practice pronunciation.
Please repeat after me.
"The car drove fast."
"He arrived late to class."
Great job guys.
I hope you now understand flat adverbs better.
Let's move on.
Let's now take a look at a few sentences
to practice finding and making adverbs that modify verbs.
Now remember,
adverbs tell us so much about the verb.
Usually they tell us 'when' or 'where'
or 'how' or 'to what degree'.
So the first example we have is,
"He easily lifted the box."
Can you spot the adverb in this sentence?
Of course the adverb is 'easily' - ending in 'ly'.
Okay and it tells us how he lifted the box.
It's an adverb of manner.
Now the second sentence,
and this is a bit more difficult,
"I will download the file tomorrow."
Now where is the adverb?
Because there is no word ending in 'ly',
so it's a bit more complicated.
Well the adverb is 'tomorrow'
and it tells you 'when'.
It's an adverb of time.
And these are sometimes a bit more difficult.
Make sure you watch my next video.
I will talk about them.
Our third example now.
"I put it there."
Again no words ending in 'ly'.
The adverb is the word 'there'.
And it tells us 'where'.
It's an adverb of place.
We will talk about them in our next videos as well.
And our last example,
"You didn't study enough for the test."
The adverb is the word 'enough'.
And it's an adverb of degree.
Okay. It tells us to what degree.
Again it's not a word ending in 'ly'.
And we will talk about adverbs of degree in our next videos.
For now, let's practice pronunciation a bit.
Please repeat after me.
"He easily lifted the box."
"I will download the file tomorrow."
"I put it there."
"You didn't study enough for the test."
Great guys.
Remember guys -
it's very important to understand adverbs
and to know how to make them.
They will make you speak English so much better.
And this video
was only a quick introduction to adverbs in English.
In our next videos,
we will focus on each kind of adverbs.
So make sure you watch the rest of the course.

Hello, everyone.
Welcome to this English course on adverbs.
And in this video I'm gonna focus on Adverbs
of Time.
Now adverbs of time tell us ‘when’ an
action happens,
and also ‘how long’ and ‘how often’.
Now these adverbs are extremely common in
English,
so you really need to know about them.
So let's start learning together.
Let's now take a look at a few example sentences
telling us ‘when’ something happened.
‘She ate ice cream yesterday.’
The adverb in this sentence is… have you
noticed?
‘yesterday’ of course.
And it's an adverb of time.
When did you eat ice cream?
‘yesterday’
I see you now.
Now where is the adverb in this sentence?
Of course the adverb is ‘now’.
Again it's an adverb of time.
When do I see you?
‘now’
‘I tell him daily.’
The adverb is ‘daily’.
Again adverb of time.
‘We met last year.’
Can you see the adverb?
Of course the adverb in this case is ‘last
year’.
Again notion of time.
When did we meet?
‘last year’
And finally, ‘He will call you later’.
The adverb in this sentence is also an adverb
of time.
It is ‘later’.
So these are all adverbs of time
And as you can see in those examples,
usually adverbs of time are at the end of
the sentence.
Let's do a bit of pronunciation practice.
Repeat after me, please.
‘She ate ice cream yesterday.’
‘I see you now.’
‘I tell him daily.’
‘We met last year.’
‘He will call you later.’
Good guys.
Let's move on.
Let's now move on to example sentences showing
us how long something happened.
These adverbs are also usually placed at the
end of the sentence.
But let's have a look.
‘She stayed home all day.’
Which part of this sentence is an adverb?
Can you see it?
Of course, ‘all day’.
And it tells us how long she stayed home.
‘I studied in Canada for a year now.’
In this sentence, ‘for a year’ tells us
how long I studied in Canada.
‘He has taught English since 1990.’
How long has he taught English?
Since 1990.
‘I studied English for four hours.’
Which pond is the adverb?
‘For four hours’
‘How long did I study English?’
‘for four hours’
And finally, ‘We have lived in New Zealand
since 2005.’
The adverb is of course ‘since 2005’.
As you can see adverbs are not necessarily
just one word.
‘since 2005’ - two words.
‘for four hours’ - three words.
Okay, so they're not just one word sometimes
they're more than one.
Now let's do a bit of pronunciation practice.
Repeat after me.
‘She stayed home all day.’
‘I studied in Canada for a year.’
‘He has taught English since 1990.’
‘I studied English for four hours.’
‘We have lived in New Zealand since 2005.’
Good guys.
Let's move on.
Adverbs telling us how often express the frequency
of an action.
They're usually placed before the main verb,
but after the auxiliary verb,
such as B may have or must.
The only exception is if the main verb is
the verb to be.
In which case the adverb goes after the main
verb.
Let's have a look at a few example sentences.
‘I often eat pizza.’
Can you spot the adverb?
It's ‘often’.
And as you can see, it is placed before the
main verb which is ‘eat’.
So ‘I often eat’.
The second example,
‘He has never drunk Cola.’
In this case, we have an auxiliary verb.
The auxiliary verb ‘have’ and the main
verb is ‘drunk’.
So the adverb is placed between the auxiliary
verb and the main verb.
‘He has never drunk.’
‘You must always brush your teeth.’
Same applies.
We have an auxiliary verb ‘must’.
Okay.
And we have the main verb ‘brush’,
so the adverb goes after the axillary verb,
but before the main verb.
‘You must always brush.’
‘I am seldom late’.
So the main verb is the verb ‘to be’.
Be careful.
So in this case the adverb goes after the
main verb.
‘I am seldom late’.
And finally,
‘He rarely lies.’
The main verb is ‘lies’.
So the adverb goes before the main verb.
‘He rarely lies’.
Okay.
Let's do a bit of pronunciation practice.
Now repeat after me.
‘I often eat pizza.’
‘He has never drunk Cola.’
‘You must always brush your teeth.’
‘I am seldom late.’
‘He rarely lies.’
Great job guys.
Let's move on.
Some adverbs expressing ‘how often’ express
the exact number of times that an action happened
They're called definite ‘adverbs of frequency’.
And in this case, they're usually placed at
the end of the sentence.
Let's have a look at a few examples.
‘I visit my dentist yearly.’
The adverb is ‘yearly’.
Okay.
‘Once a year’ and it expresses the exact
number of times that I visit my dentist.
It's a definite adverb of frequency,
so it's placed at the end of the sentence.
Other example,
‘He goes to the gym once a week.’
Again we have a definite adverb of frequency
which is ‘once a week’.
‘I work five days a week.’
Same thing.
We have a definite adverb of frequency which
is ‘five days a week’
so it's placed at the end of the sentence.
And finally,
‘I saw the movie five times.’
Again ‘five times’ expresses the exact
number of times that I saw the movie.
Let's do a bit of pronunciation practice.
Repeat after me.
‘I visit my dentist yearly.’
‘He goes to the gym once a week.’
‘I work five days a week.’
‘I saw the movie five times.’
Good.
Moving on now.
If you want to use more than one adverb of
time in a sentence,
you should put them in the following order:
First, ‘how long?’.
Second, ‘how often?’.
And finally, ‘when?’.
Let's take a look at a very good example sentence.
‘He taught at the school for ten days every
month last year.’
Now as you can see, first, we're told ‘how
long’ - for ten days.
Then, we're told ‘how often’ - every month.
And finally, were told ‘when’ exactly
- last year.
This is a very good sentence using the different
kinds of adverbs of time in the right order,
so I hope you can do the same let's practice
pronunciation together.
Now repeat after me.
‘He taught at the school for 10 days every
month last year.’
Good job, guys.
Let's now practice together okay guys.
Let's do a bit of extra practice.
I have four example sentences for you to spot
adverbs of time,
so let's get started.
‘He has been to Canada three times.’
Can you spot the adverb?
Of course the adverb is the adverb frequency
‘three times’.
Okay.
How often has he been to Canada three times.
The second example is,
‘Generally I don't like to eat spicy food.’
The adverb is ‘generally’.
And remember I told you some adverbs of frequency
work well at the beginning of a sentence if
you want to emphasize the frequency,
so ‘generally’ is one of them.
Another example would be ‘sometimes’.
Next example.
‘He will clean his room regularly from now
on.’
Now be careful.
In this case, we have two adverbs.
The first one ‘regularly’.
The second one ‘from now on’.
Keeping the order, ‘regularly’ is ‘how
often?’
followed by ‘when?’ – ‘from now on’.
And finally,
‘I've been going to church for four days
every month since 1996.’
Three adverbs in this case.
‘how long?’ – ‘for four days’
‘how often?’
- ‘every month’
‘when?’ – ‘since 1996’
Let's practice pronunciation now.
Please repeat after me.
‘He's been to Canada three times.’
‘Generally, I don't like to eat spicy food.’
‘He will clean his room regularly from now
on.’
‘I've been going to church for four days
every month since 1996.’
Great job.
Moving on.
Okay guys.
You now know a lot more about adverbs of time.
Remember these adverbs are extremely common
in English,
so it's very important for you to learn about
them.
They will improve your English skills very
quickly.
Okay now there are obviously other types of
adverbs
- adverbs of place of manner and of degree
And I will focus on these in my next videos,
so check them out.

Hello, everyone.
Welcome to this English course on adverbs.
In this video, we're gonna talk about adverbs
of place.
Adverbs of place tell us where an action happens.
They could also give us information on direction,
distance, or movement.
Let's take a look at a quick example.
‘Let's go and play outdoors.’
Now in this sentence, the adverb of place
is ‘outdoors’.
It answers the question, ‘Where?’.
Where?
‘Outdoors.’
Okay.
Now let's learn a bit more about adverbs
of place together.
Let's get started.
First, let's talk a bit about ‘here’ and
‘there’.
‘Here’ and ‘there’ are two adverbs
of place that relates specifically to the speaker.
‘Here’ meaning close to the speaker.
Close to me.
‘There’ meaning farther away.
Okay. Let's take a look at a few examples.
‘I put my keys there.’
So the adverb ‘there’ indicating the location
of the keys
and they're a bit farther away from me.
Okay?
Second example.
‘Please come here.’
‘Here’ being the adverb, you know, meaning
to me.
So these adverbs are place at the end of the
sentence.
But you can also put them at the beginning
if you want to emphasize the location.
For example,
‘Here are your keys.’
‘Here’.
close to me.
‘There is your umbrella.’
Over there, farther away.
So in these two cases, I want to emphasize
the location
so I place the adverb at the beginning of
the sentence.
Okay, guys?
Let's now practice pronunciation.
Please repeat after me.
‘I put my keys there.’
‘Please come here.’
‘Here are your keys.’
‘There is your umbrella.’
Good job, guys.
Let's move on.
Let's now take a look at adverbs of movement
and directions.
Some adverbs end in ‘-ward’.
Or ‘-wards’.
It's the same thing.
And they express movement in a particular direction.
For example, ‘homeward’ or ‘homewards’
‘backward’ or ‘backwards’
‘forward’ or ‘forwards’
‘onward’ or ‘onwards’
So they express a movement.
And they specify a particular direction.
Let's take a look at a few examples sentences.
‘We drove eastwards.’ or ‘eastward’.
It would be the exact same thing.
‘The children looked upwards at the stars.’
‘You need to move forward one step.’
So each time you have a movement specifying
the direction of this movement.
Okay?
Good.
Let's practice pronunciation now.
Repeat after me please.
‘We drove eastwards.’
‘The children looked upwards at the stars.’
‘You need to move forward one step.’
Good, guys.
Let's move on.
Some adverbs express both movement and location
at the same time.
For example, when I say, ‘The child went
indoors,’
There's a movement.
The child goes into the house.
But it's also a location.
He's inside – indoors.
Another example would be,
‘He's going abroad.’
It's a movement, but it's also a location
abroad in another country.
Finally I could say,
‘The rock rolled downhill.’
There's the movement going down, but it's also
a location.
Now let's practice pronunciation.
Please repeat after me.
‘The child went indoors.’
‘He is going abroad.’
‘The rock rolled downhill.’
Good job, guys.
moving on.
‘everywhere’
‘somewhere’
‘anywhere’ or ‘nowhere’
are adverbs of place as well.
But they are special because they describe
a location or direction
that is indefinite or unspecific.
For example,
‘I looked everywhere for my car keys.’
‘I'd like to go somewhere for my vacation.’
‘We're going nowhere.’
‘Is there anywhere to get a coffee?’
Let's practice pronunciation together.
Repeat after me.
‘I looked everywhere for my car keys.’
‘I'd like to go somewhere for my vacation.’
‘We're going nowhere.’
‘Is there anywhere to get a coffee?’
Great guys. Let's move on.
Just so you know, some adverbs can also be
prepositions.
Now the difference is that an adverb stands
alone.
A preposition is always followed by a noun.
So for example, ‘outside’.
‘outside’ can be an adverb?
For example, ‘we were waiting outside.’
It's an adverb.
It stands alone.
But it can also be a preposition.
For example, ‘We were waiting outside his
office.’
It goes with a noun.
Another example, ‘I kicked the ball around.’
‘around’ is an adverb, in this case it
stands alone.
But it can also be a preposition.
‘I kicked the ball around the field.’
It goes with a noun.
Okay?
So an adverb stands alone.
A preposition is followed by a noun.
Now let's practice pronunciation.
please repeat after me.
‘We were waiting outside.’
‘We were waiting outside his office.’
‘I kicked the ball around.’
‘I kicked the ball around the field.’
Very good, guys.
Let's now move on to practice, shall we?
Okay, guys.
Let's do a bit of extra practice.
I have a few example sentences for you to
spot adverbs of place.
First example,
‘John looked around but he
couldn't find his wife.’
Now remember, adverbs of place, answer the
question – ‘where?’
Can you spot the adverb here?
Of course, it’s the word ‘around’.
Where did John look?
He looked ‘around’.
Second example,
‘I searched everywhere I could think of.’
Now where did I search?
‘everywhere’
‘everywhere’ is the adverb.
‘Let's go back.’
Now what's the adverb in this sentence?
It’s ‘back’ - of course.
Where?
‘back’.
Next example, ‘Come in.’
Where?
‘in’.
Okay, the adverb is ‘in’.
Okay, so adverbs of place answer the question
– ‘where?’.
Okay, Let's practice pronunciation.
Please repeat the sentences after me.
‘John looked around but he couldn't find
his wife.’
‘I searched everywhere I could think of.’
‘Let's go back.’
‘Come in.’
Good job, guys.
Okay, guys.
You now know a lot more about adverbs of place.
Now I know it's hard to learn about all these
adverbs,
but don't worry, you'll get there.
You just need a bit of practice.
Okay?
Now I'm gonna carry on talking about adverbs
in my next videos,
so make sure to watch them.

hello everyone and welcome to this
English course on adverbs in this video
I'm gonna talk to you about adverbs of
degree adverbs of degree tell us about
the intensity of something the power of
something now in English they're usually
placed before the adjective or adverb or
verb the D modify but obviously as
always there are exceptions and there
are very common adverbs of degree that
I'm sure you use all the time to enough
very extremely but there are so many
others okay so let's dive into it and
learn about adverbs of degree let's have
a look and a few examples of adverbs of
degree especially how they are used with
adjectives adverbs and verbs
now adverbs of degree are usually placed
before the adjectives and adverbs that
they modify and before the main verb of
the sentence for example in the sentence
the water was extremely cold
you have the adjective cold and the
adverb extremely that modifies the
adjective cold and as you can see the
adverb is placed before the adjective
that it modifies second example he just
left
in this case the adverb just comes
before the verb left which is the main
verb of the sentence she is running very
fast now in this case we have two
adverbs the adverb fast and the adverb
very that modifies the adverb
and as you can see our adverb very is
placed before the adverb that it
modifies and finally they are completely
exhausted from the trip
the adverb completely modifies the
adjective exhausted and is therefore
placed before it I hope you understand
guys let's move on okay guys let's
practice pronunciation now please repeat
after me
the water was extremely cold he just
left
she is running very fast they are
completely exhausted from the trip
good job guys let's move on some very
common adverbs of degree in English are
enough very and two let's look at a few
examples is your coffee hot enough so in
this case our adverb enough modifies the
adjective hot he didn't work hard enough
in that case our adverb enough modifies
another adverb the adverb hard and as
you can see the adverb enough is usually
placed after the adjective or adverb
that it modifies another example is very
the girl was very beautiful
so the adverb very modifies our
adjective beautiful he worked very
quickly so in this case aren't very
modifies the adverb quickly and as you
can see the very is usually placed
before the word that it modifies and
our third example is - this coffee is
too hot it modifies the adjective hot he
works too hard in that case - modifies
the adverb hard and as you can see - is
usually placed before the word that it
modifies okay
hope you got it let's move on let's now
focus on pronunciation please repeat
after me is your coffee hot enough he
didn't work hard enough the girl was
very beautiful he worked very quickly
this coffee is too hot he works too hard
okay guys let's move on okay guys let's
do a little bit of extra practice with a
few example sentences he speaks very
quickly can you spot the adverb of
degree it's very and it modifies the
other adverb of the sentence
quickly he speaks too quickly now
another very common adverb of degree to
be very careful there's a difference
between very and to very is a fact to
means there's a problem okay he speaks
so quickly that you cannot understand
he speaks too quickly another example my
teacher is terribly angry where is the
adverb of degree
it's the adverb terribly that modifies
the adjective angry
they were almost finished can you spot
the adverb
it's almost and it modifies the verb
finished okay so we're not finished yet
we're almost finished
and finally this box isn't big enough
the adverb of degree in this case is the
adverb enough and it modifies our
adjective big and remember enough
usually goes after the work that it
modifies okay I hope you get it guys
time for some pronunciation practice
please repeat after me he speaks very
quickly he speaks too quickly my teacher
is terribly angry they were almost
finished
this box isn't big enough good job guys

adverbs of degree and I'm sure this

Hello, everyone.
Welcome to this English course on adverbs.
In today's video,
I'm going to talk to you
about adverbs of manner.
Adverbs of manner
tell you how something happens.
And they're usually placed
after the main verb
or after its object.
Let's take a look at a few sentences.
‘He swims well.’
The adverb ‘well’
tells you how he swims
and is placed after the main verb ‘swims’.
‘He plays the piano beautifully.’
The adverb ‘beautifully’
tells you how he plays the piano
and is placed after the piano
which is the object of the verb to play.
Hope you get it.
Let's get into more detail now.
Adverbs of manner are usually placed
after the main verb or after the objects.
For example, ‘He left the room quickly.’
The adverb ‘quickly’ is placed after the object, ‘the room’.
Now just so you know,
some adverbs not all of them,
but some adverbs,
can also be placed before the verb.
So in this case,
you can also say,
‘He quickly left the room.’
Let's practice pronunciation. Repeat after me.
‘He left the room quickly.’
‘He quickly left the room.’
Good guys. Let's move on.
What's very important for you to know
is that an adverb of manner
cannot come between a  verb and its direct object.
Okay, so it must be placed either before the main verb,
or after at the end of the clause.
So let's take a look at a few examples.
‘He ate quickly his dinner.’
Now this sentence is incorrect.
Okay?
‘ate’ is the verb.
‘his dinner’ is the direct object of the verb.
So the adverb ‘quickly’ cannot be placed
between those two. Okay?
So you should say, ‘He ate his dinner quickly.’
The adverb is at the end and that's correct.
Or ‘He quickly ate his dinner.’
That's also correct.
The adverb is placed before the main verb.
Another example,
‘He gave me gently a hug.’
Now this is incorrect.
You cannot separate the verb ‘give’
from its direct object ‘a hug’.
So two correct sentences would be first,
‘He gave me a hug gently.’
with the adverb at the end of the sentence.
Or
‘He gently gave me a hug.’
The adverb comes before the verb.
Hope you get it.
Let's now practice pronunciation.
Please repeat the sentence after me.
‘He ate his dinner quickly.’
‘He quickly ate his dinner.’
‘He gave me a hug gently,’
‘He gently gave me a hug.’
Good, guys.
Let's move on.
Time now to practice.
Here are a few example sentences
for you to spot the adverbs of manner.
‘He swam well.’
As you can see, we use the adverb ‘well’.
It tells you how he swam,
And it's placed after the main verb, ‘swam’.
‘The rain felt hard.’
Again, our adverb ‘hard’
tells you how the rain fell,
And is placed after the verb.
‘The children were playing happily.’
The adverb is… Can you find it? ‘happily’.
Of course.
‘She angrily slammed the door.’
Can you see the adverb?
It's ‘angrily’.
How did she slam the door?
‘angrily’.
And finally,
‘Slowly she picked up the flower.’
Can you spot the adverb of manner?
It's ‘slowly’.
And it's at the beginning of the sentence,
Because we want to emphasize the manner.
And this is also something very common
when you read books.
Okay, guys. Let's now practice pronunciation.
Please repeat after me.
‘He swam well.’
‘The rain fell hard.’
‘The children were playing happily.’
‘She angrily slammed the door.’
‘Slowly she picked up the flower.’
Great job.
Okay, guys.
That's it for this video.
Please make sure you watch the other videos on adverbs,
and keep practicing.
Adverbs are extremely common in English.
And they will make you speak a lot better.
Thanks for watching and see you next time.

Hello, everybody.
Welcome to this English course.
In today's video, I'm going to tell you about
nouns.
Because in English, nouns are very important.
They are the basic element of a sentence.
So if you want to speak English,
you need to know about the different kinds
of nouns.
And I'm going to try and teach you as well
as I can.
Let's get started!
Ok, so let's start with concrete nouns.
Now in English, concrete nouns are people
places or things,
including animals.
That you can see, that you can smell,
or taste, or hear, or touch.
So you can basically use your five senses.
Let me give you a few examples.
If we talk about people,
you could say, a man
or a teacher,
or me, Fanny.
Or Mr. Smith.
If we talk about places,
you could say,
a house, a school.
You could name a city like London.
Very nice city.
Or a beach.
And if you talk about things,
you could say a shoe,
you could say a marker,
you could talk about a dog
or food like a pizza.
These are concrete nouns....ok.
Now let's move on to abstract nouns.
So abstract nouns, unlike concrete nouns,
are ideas, concepts, emotions.
And you can't see an idea.
You can't smell a concept.
You can't taste an emotion.
Or hear it.
Or touch it.
So they are nouns.
They are things that exist, but
you cannot see them, or taste them.
You can't use your five sense.
To give you a few examples,
we could talk about love,
or time,
or religion,
rules.
These are all words that represent
ideas, concepts...
okay
They're abstract nouns in English.
Now, let's get into more detail about nouns.
Let's now see the difference between common
nouns
and proper nouns which are very important
in English.
So common nouns and proper nouns
refer to people, places, things, ideas.
Let's see a few examples.
We could talk about people for example.
A woman.
That's a common noun.
But if we talk about a specific woman,
for example, me, Fanny.
That becomes a proper noun with a capital
'F'.
because, and you should know this,
proper nouns are always capitalized.
You could talk about places.
A city.
That's a common noun.
But then you can name a specific city.
Let's take a
great city, London, of course.
With a capital 'L'.
Remember proper nouns - always capitalized.
We can talk about things for
example.
An animal.
Let's take a dog.
A dog.
That's a common noun.
But if we take a specific dog, like Snoopy
- capital 'S',
that's the proper noun.
If we talk about things again, but for example,
a car,
that's a common noun.
But if we name the brand, the specific brand
of the car like Volvo,
that's a proper noun.
And it takes a capital 'V'.
And finally, and we can say, a team - common
noun.
But if we name a specific team, for example,
the best football team, Manchester United,
then that's a proper noun
and it's capitalized.
Now mind you,
'team', is a special word because it's called
a collective noun in English
because it refers to a group of people.
So collective nouns can be used as
singular nouns or plural nouns.
But we will talk about this again later.
So now that we know a lot about nouns in English,
Let's practice finding nouns in a sentence.
Okay, first,
In my class at Oxford University, I have many
friends.
My best friend is Jan.
I have a lot of love for her.
Jan has a cute dog.
Its name is Juju.
What are the nouns in these sentences?
If we take the first sentence,
In my class at Oxford University, I have many
friends.
We have, class, and friends.
These are common nouns.
We also have a proper noun, Oxford University.
We know it's a proper noun because it's capitalized.
The second sentence is,
My best friend is Jen.
Now in this sentence,
the noun is, friend - common noun.
And there's also the word, Jen,
is also a noun but a proper noun.
As you can see it's capitalized.
Then, I have a lot of love for her.
What noun can you see?
Of course, 'love'.
Remember the abstract noun
we talked about a few minutes ago.
And finally, Jan has a cute dog.
Its name is Juju.
What nouns can we find?
We can see, 'Jen', again - proper noun.
'Dog' - common noun.
But also, 'name', and 'Juju'.
'Name's' a common noun.
'Juju' is the proper noun.
It's capitalized.
As you probably know,
I haven't mentioned, 'I', or 'her', or 'its'.
They are also nouns, but they are pronouns
and
they're considered a different category in
English.
We will talk about them in another video .
Great job guys!
Thank you for watching my video.
I hope you now have a better
understanding of nouns in English.
Please keep practicing.
Practice makes perfect.
I'm sure you will very soon be able to
recognize nouns in a sentence.
Please make sure to watch my next video as
I keep on talking about nouns.
See you.

Hello guys!
And welcome to this English course on nouns.
In today’s video, we’re going to talk
about singular and plural nouns.
When you speak English, it’s very important
to know the difference between a singular
noun and a plural noun.
Ok?
So I will explain to you the different rules.
And we will practice together.
Let’s get started.
Ok guys, the first you need to know is that
a singular noun means one.
So, for example, I can say, ‘cat’.
‘a cat’
‘one cat’
‘school’
‘a school’
‘one school’
‘team’
Now don’t forget, ‘team’ is a collective
noun.
It’s a group of people, but still, it’s
a singular noun.
We talk about ‘a team’, or ‘one team.
‘lady’
‘monkey’
‘tomato’
‘a tomato’
‘one tomato’
Or ‘piano’.
Now, if we talk about plural nouns, it means
more than one.
So for example, two, three, four, or many.
If we take our words again, ‘a cat’ becomes
‘cats’.
‘two cats’
‘three cats’
‘many cats’
‘school’’ becomes ‘schools’.
‘team’ becomes ‘teams’.
Ok, so you just add an ‘s’.
Now ‘lady’ becomes ‘ladies.
‘monkey’ becomes ‘monkeys’.
But, two different rules.
As you can see, ‘lady’ is consonant +
‘y’.
Now when you have consonant + ‘y’, in
an English word, the plural will be ‘ies’.
‘lady’
‘ladies’
But when you have vowel + ‘y’ like ‘monkey’,
it just becomes ‘monkeys’.
You simply add an ‘s’.
Ok, ‘monkey’ becomes ‘monkeys’.
‘tomato’ becomes ‘tomatoes’.
‘piano’ ‘pianos’
Again, two different rules.
Now ‘tomato’ becomes ‘tomatoes’.
You add ‘es’.
And with most words ending in ‘o’, so
consonant + ‘o’, you will add ‘es’.
But sometimes, you will only add ‘s’.
Like ‘piano’, ‘pianos’.
There is no particular rule for this.
You just need to know the words that only
end with an ‘s’.
Ok, let’s move on to some pronunciation
now.
So, when it comes to pronunciation, we have
three different sounds.
The first sound is /s/.
The second sound is /z/.
And the third sounds is /Iz/.
So let’s review some words together and
be really careful, what sound do you hear?
‘cats’
‘cats’
What can you hear?
/s/
Can you repeat after me.
‘cats’
‘cats’
The second word is ‘schools’.
‘schools’
What sound can you hear?
Of course, /z/.
Repeat after me.
‘schools’
‘schools’
The third words is ‘teams’.
What sound can you hear?
Again, /z/.
Repeat after me.
‘teams’
‘teams’
Then we have ‘ladies’.
‘ladies’
/z/
Repeat after me.
‘ladies’
‘ladies’
Then ‘monkeys’.
/z/ again.
Repeat after me.
‘monkeys’.
‘monkeys’
Then we have ‘tomatoes’.
Again, it’s the /z/ sound.
‘tomatoes’
‘tomatoes’
And finally, ‘pianos’.
/z/
‘pianos’
‘pianos’
Let’s move on to other rules now.
Ok guys, let’s now talk about nouns that
end in ‘s’, ‘sh’, ‘x’, ‘ch’,
or ‘z’.
Now to make the plural form of these nouns,
you will add ‘es’.
And the sound will be /Iz/.
Let’s review some words together.
‘bus’ becomes ‘buses’.
‘bush’ ‘bushes’
‘fox’ ‘foxes’
‘beach’ ‘beaches’
‘quiz’ ‘quizzes’
Can you repeat after me?
‘buses’ ‘buses’
‘bushes’ ‘bushes’
‘foxes’ ‘foxes’
‘beaches’ ‘beaches’
‘quizzes’ ‘quizzes’
Let’s move on.
Ok, guys.
Moving on to nouns that end in ‘f’ or
‘fe’.
For example, ‘roof’ becomes ‘roofs’.
‘safe’ ‘safes’
So you simply add an ‘s’.
Then we have ‘leaf’ that becomes ‘leaves’.
Wait a minute.
What happened?
Well, ya, sometimes in English, a word ending
in ‘f’ becomes a word ending in ‘ves’
in plural.
That’s not a rule.
But some words end in ‘ves’, you just
have to learn them I’m afraid.
Another word, ‘wife’.
And again, ‘ves’.
‘wives’
‘shelf’ ‘shelves’
Again, this ‘ves’ ending.
Now let’s focus on pronunciation.
‘roofs’
So it’s an /s/ sound.
‘roofs’
‘roofs’
Good job.
‘safes’
‘safes’
Have you heard the /s/ sound?
‘safes’
Then we have ‘leaves’.
And this time it’s a /z/ sound.
Repeat after me.
‘leaves’
‘leaves’
Great.
Moving on.
‘wives’
‘wives’
And finally,
‘shelves’
‘shelves’
Great job guys.
Let’s move on to practice now.
Well students, let’s now practice together.
I’m going to give you a singular noun, and
I want you to try and find the plural form
of this singular noun.
Ok?
Let’s give it a try.
The first word is ‘baby’.
‘baby’
Don’t forget, it ends with consonant + ‘y’.
Do you remember the rule?
It’s ‘babies’ with ‘ies’.
Very nice.
‘baby’ ‘babies’
The second word is ‘toy’.
Hmmm, vowel + ‘y’.
So this time, ‘toys’.
You simply add an ‘s’.
Then we have ‘wish’.
Wish is a word that ends in ‘sh’.
Remember the rule.
‘wishes’
You add ‘es’.
‘taxi’ becomes ‘taxis’.
You simply add an ‘s’.
‘choice’ ‘choices’
Simply add an ‘s’ as well.
Then we have the word ‘wolf’.
Aha!
It’s a word ending in ‘f’.
Is it a word with ‘ves’?
It is.
‘wolves’
And finally,
‘photo’
Now remember the words ending in ‘o’?
You can add ‘es’ or simply ‘s’.
Well with photo, you simply add an ‘s’.
‘photos’
Now if we focus on pronunciation now.
Repeat the words after me.
‘babies’
The sound is /z/
‘babies’
‘toys’
‘toys’
‘wishes’
Remember this /Iz/ sound?
Repeat after me.
‘wishes’
‘taxis’
‘taxis’
‘choices’
‘choices’
‘wolves’
‘wolves’
And finally,
‘photos’ ‘photos’
Excellent job guys.
Now let’s move on to some example sentences.
I have some example sentences for you guys.
Using singular and plural nouns.
I would like you to repeat the sentences after
me.
And be really careful to sue proper pronunciation.
Let’s get started.
First,
‘I want a dog.’
‘I like dogs.’
Repeat after me, guys.
‘I want a dog.’
‘I like dogs.’
The second sentence.
‘I don’t want a fox.’
‘I don’t like foxes.’
After me, guys.
‘I don’t want a fox.’
‘I don’t like foxes.’
Great, moving on the to the third sentence.
‘I bought a watch.’
‘I have many watches.’
Repeat after me.
‘I bought a watch.’
‘I have many watches.’
Good job.
Sentence four now.
‘I have a new stereo.’
‘Now, I have two stereos.’
After me.
‘I have a new stereo.’
‘Now, I have two stereos.’
Excellent!
And finally,
‘There’s a knife.’
‘There are six knives in the kitchen.’
Repeat after me.
‘There’s a knife.’
‘There are six knives in the kitchen.’
Amazing job guys.
Very nice.
I hoped this has helped.
I hope you now understand better, singular
and plural nouns in English.
Now, I haven’t talked about all the pronunciation
rules,
But I hope you have a good sense now of how
pronounce plural forms.
Make sure you watch my next video if you want
to know more about nouns in English.

Hello, guys.
Welcome to this English course on nouns.
In today’s video, I’m going to tell you
about irregular plural nouns.
Now there are crazy ways of making plural
forms in English.
And there are a lot of irregular forms.
I want you to know about them, so let’s
get started.
Again, guys, there are so many irregular plural
forms in English.
And I’m afraid there are no particular rules.
You just need to learn the words.
But I’m going to try and tell you about
the most common ones.
Ok?
Let’s review some words together.
Ok, so, for example.
We have a singular noun which is ‘woman’.
It’s plural form is ‘women’.
‘woman’ ‘women’
Then we have ‘man’.
The singular noun, ‘a man’, it becomes
‘men’.
‘a child’ becomes ‘children’
‘a tooth’ ‘teeth’
‘a foot’ becomes ‘feet’
‘a person’ becomes ‘people’.
‘a mouse’ becomes ‘mice’
Ok, let’s move on to pronunciation now.
Well students, let’s work on pronunciation
a bit.
Please repeat after me.
‘woman’ ‘woman’
‘women’ ‘women’
Good.
‘man’ ‘man’
‘men’ ‘men’
‘child’ ‘child’
‘children’ ‘children’
Very good guys.
Moving on.
‘tooth’ ‘tooth’
‘teeth’ ‘teeth’
‘foot’ ‘foot’
‘feet’ ‘feet’
‘person’ ‘person’
‘people’ ‘people’
Very good guys.
And the last one.
‘mouse’ ‘mouse’
‘mice’ ‘mice’
Excellent, guys.
Let’s now move on to other irregular plural
forms.
Now there are words that have the exact same
singular and plural forms.
They are not common, but you need to know
a few.
Let’s take a look together.
As you can see, ‘sheep’ is the singular
form.
But the plural form is not ‘sheeps’.
It is ‘sheep’.
Same goes for ‘deer’ ‘deer’.
‘moose’ ‘moose’
‘fish’ ‘fish’
‘aircraft’ ‘aircraft’
Ok, so you will say, “I see one sheep.”
But also, “I see two sheep.”
The exact same word.
Ok, let’s go back for pronunciation.
I want you to repeat after me.
‘sheep’ ‘sheep’
‘deer’ ‘deer’
‘moose’ ‘moose’
‘fish’ ‘fish’
‘aircraft’ ‘aircraft’
Good job guys.
Let’s move to other irregular forms.
Some nouns are never singular.
We always use their plural forms.
I have a few common ones for you guys.
Let’s have a look.
‘jeans’
‘pants’
‘glasses’
‘sunglasses’
‘clothes’
‘scissors’
‘pajamas’
So you will say, “I have some jeans.”
Or, “I have scissors.”
But you cannot say, “I have a jean.”
It is incorrect in English.
Let’s work a bit on pronunciation.
Repeat after me, please.
‘jeans’ ‘jeans’
‘pants’ ‘pants’
‘glasses’ ‘glasses’
‘sunglasses’ ‘sunglasses’
‘clothes’ ‘clothes’
‘scissors’ ‘scissors’
And finally,
‘pajamas’ ‘pajamas’
Good guys.
Let’s now look at other irregular plural
forms.
Now, just a few words about nouns in English
that have Latin and Greek origins.
Their plural forms are very weird.
It’s a bit complicated, so we’re not going
to into too much detail.
Don’t worry too much about them.
But just a few words that I think you should
know.
First, we have words ending in ‘a’.
Their plural form will end in ‘ae’.
For example,
‘antenna’ becomes ‘antennae’
‘alumna’ ‘alumnae’
Words ending in ‘us’, us, will end in
‘i’.
‘octopus’ ‘octopi’
‘cactus’ ‘cacti’
Words ending in ‘is’, will end in ‘es’.
‘is’ becomes ‘es’.
For example, ‘analysis’ ‘analyses’
‘diagnosis’ ‘diagnoses’
And finally, words ending in ‘on’, end
in ‘a’.
‘criterion’ ‘criteria’
‘phenomenon’ ‘phenomena’
These plural forms are very difficult, guys.
Even native speakers make a lot of mistakes,
so don’t worry too much about them.
I just wanted to give you a little taste of
Latin and Greek plurals.
Let’s move on to example sentences now.
Ok, guys.
I have a few example sentences for you.
It’s a great opportunity to practice saying
irregular plural forms in English.
Be very careful to use proper pronunciation
as well.
Let’s start.
First, ‘my sister has one child’ ‘my
brother has two children’.
Repeat after me.
‘my sister has one child’ ‘my brother
has two children’.
Next.
‘I’m a quiet person, so I don’t talk
to many people.’
Please repeat after me.
‘I’m a quiet person, so I don’t talk
to many people.’
Good guys.
Next sentence.
‘Did you catch one fish or two fish at the
lake?’
Repeat after me, please.
‘Did you catch one fish or two fish at the
lake?’
Very good.
Next sentence.
‘I have one pair of glasses and two pairs
of sunglasses.’
Repeat after me.
‘I have one pair of glasses and two pairs
of sunglasses.’
Excellent, guys.
And finally,
‘He has one cactus in his front yard, but
many cacti in his back yard.’
Repeat after me.
‘He has one cactus in his front yard, but
many cacti in his back yard.’
Ok, students.
I hope you repeated after me.
And you practiced your pronunciation.
I hope you now have a better understanding
of irregular plural forms in English.
There are many of them.
Not many rules to follow.
A lot of words to memorize.
But, I’m sure with a little bit of practice,
you can do it.

Hello guys, welcome back to this English course
on nouns.
In today’s video, I’m going to tell you
about compound nouns.
They are very common in English and there
are thousands of them.
You need to know about them.
Let’s get started.
A compound noun is made up of two different
words.
So you take two words, you put them together,
to create a new noun.
They’re usually quite easy to understand.
For example, ‘full moon’.
‘Full’ is obviously the adjective describing
the moon.
Let’s take a look at other examples, and
how to create compound nouns.
Sometimes, compound nouns are a single noun.
Like, ‘toothpaste’.
Sometimes, they’re two or more words hyphenated.
Such as ‘mother-in-law’.
And sometimes, they’re two separate words,
like ‘ice cream’.
Now, you have to be careful.
Sometimes, you have a simple adjective plus
a noun like ‘a green house’.
But you also have a compound noun which is
a different meaning.
‘A greenhouse’.
Now, ‘a green house’, is a house which
is green.
But the compound noun, ‘a greenhouse’,
is a place where you grow plants.
Completely different meaning.
Ok, so you have to be careful.
Stresses can help.
Usually the stress is on the first syllable
in compound nouns.
Ok, I hope you get it guys.
Let’s take a closer look now at compound
nouns.
Ok, let’s now take a look at the parts of
speech that make up a compound noun.
We can have a noun and another noun.
Like, ‘bedroom’.
We can also have a noun and a verb.
Like, ‘haircut’.
A noun and a preposition.
Like, ‘passer-by’.
A verb and a noun.
Like, ‘washing machine’.
A verb and a preposition.
Like, ‘drawback’.
A preposition and a noun.
Like, ‘underground’.
An adjective and a ver.
Like, ‘dry-cleaning’.
An adjective and a noun.
Like, ‘software’.
Or a preposition and a verb.
Like, ‘input’.
As you can see guys, there are so many ways
to create compound nouns with different words.
Now let’s get back to our example for pronunciation.
Please repeat after me.
Bedroom
Bedroom
Haircut
Haircut
Passer-by
Passer-by
Washing machine
Washing machine
Drawback
Drawback
Underground
Underground
Dry-cleaning
Dry-cleaning
Software
Software
Input
Input
Good job guys.
Now let’s now move on to plural compound
nouns.
So when we want to make compound nouns plural,
there are rules to follow.
If you have a single word, you simply add
an ‘s’.
But if you have separate words, whether hyphenated
or not, you will make the most significant
word plural.
Let’s take a look at examples.
‘Newspaper’ will simply be ‘newspapers’.
So I have man newspapers.
Swimming pool.
Now, what’s the most significant word?
Well, it is ‘pool’.
So we will say, ‘there are two swimming
pools’.
You cannot say, ‘there are two swimmings
pools.’
No ‘s’ at swimming.
Brother-in-law
What’s the most significant word?
Well of course, it is ‘brother’.
So you will say, “I have two brothers-in-law”.
And finally, ‘woman doctor’.
Now, what’s the most significant word?
Actually, both words are significant.
So we will both make them plural.
Remember, the plural form of ‘woman’ is
‘women’.
So we will say, “Four women doctors work
at the hospital”.
Let’s work on pronunciation.
Can you repeat after me, please.
I have man newspapers.
I have man newspapers.
There are two swimming pools.
There are two swimming pools.
I have two brothers-in-law.
I have two brothers-in-law.
And finally,
Four women doctors work at the hospital.
Four women doctors work at the hospital.
Good job guys.
Now let’s move on to practice.
To practice, I have a few sentences.
And I want you to tell me if we are using
compound nouns or not.
Let’s take a look.
I want to drink some cold water.
Is ‘cold water’ a compound noun?
What do you think?
It isn’t.
‘Cold’ is a simply adjective describing
the water.
She has a new boy friend.
Is boy friend a compound noun?
Well, it isn’t in this case.
He’s your friend and he’s a boy.
But the compound noun, ‘boyfriend’, in
one word, exists and has a different meaning.
Then, your boyfriend is more than a friend.
He’s the boy you’re having a relationship
with.
Other example.
The blue bird was singing in the tree.
Is ‘blue bird’ a compound noun?
Not in this case.
It’s a simple bird and it’s blue.
But, the compound noun, ‘bluebird’, in
one word, exists.
It’s a specific bird.
Let’s meet at the bus stop.
Is ‘bus stop’ a compound noun?
What do you think?
It is.
I have two alarms clock.
What about ‘alarms clock’?
Well, it is a compound noun, but there is
a big mistake.
Can you see it?
Of course, the plural form.
The plural form is not ‘alarms clock’.
But, ‘alarm clocks’.
Because the most significant word is ‘clock’.
Ok guys, let’s move on.
Thank you for watching.
I hope you better understand compound nouns
and how to create them.
There are so many compound nouns in the English
language, but they are usually very easy to
understand.
And if you’re not sure, look it up in a
dictionary.
The dictionary will tell you if it’s a compound
noun or not.
Thank you for watching guys.
And see you in the next videos.

Hello, guys.
Welcome back to this English course on nouns.
In this video, I’m going to tell you about
countable and uncountable nouns.
It’s very important to know the difference
between countable and uncountable nouns in
English.
And students often get confused.
So please listen to me very carefully.
Let’s get started.
Countable nouns are nouns that you can count.
Uncountable nouns are nouns that you can’t
count.
They’re usually a type or a group.
And they’re always singular.
Let’s look at a few examples.
Countable nouns – you can say, “a dog.”
You can say, “one dog,” “two dogs,”
“three dogs,” and so on.
“Man.”
You can say, “a man.”
“Two men.”
“Idea.”
You can say, “one idea,” “two ideas,”
and so on.
“Computer.”
Again, you can say, “one computer, two computers.”
And, “house.”
Well, you can say, “one house, two houses,
three houses,” and so on.
These are countable nouns.
You can count them.
But if we look at uncountable nouns.
When you say, “water.”
You can’t say, “One water, two waters.”
It doesn’t make any sense.
You cannot count water.
Same goes for air.
You can’t say, “one air, two airs.”
It’s just ‘air’.
It’s uncountable.
‘traffic’
‘English’
‘Equipment’
These are all uncountable nouns.
You cannot count them
And they’re always singular.
Okay, guys.
Now, let’s take a closer look at rules with
countable nouns and uncountable nouns.
So how do we know if a word is countable or
uncountable?
Well there are a few tricks that can help.
Let’s look at these words.
Some groups of words are very often uncountable.
And this can help you.
For example, liquids.
Water, juice, milk, beer.
All those words are uncountable.
Powders.
Sugar, flour, salt, rice.
Uncountable words as well.
Materials.
Such as wood, plastic, metal, or paper.
Food as well.
Like fruit, meat, cheese, and bread.
And finally, abstract ideas.
Like time, information, love, and beauty.
Another trick is that most of the time, you
can measure uncountable nouns.
Let’s look at examples.
For example, if we take liquids.
I have two liters of milk.
Now, you cannot count milk.
But you can measure milk.
And you can count liters.
So you can say, “I have two liters of milk.”
You can say, “I have a glass of water.”
Or “I have glasses of water.”
“Cups of coffee.”
“Bottles of water.”
So you can measure this uncountable noun.
Same goes with powders.
“I have one kilogram of sugar.”
“Two kilograms of sugar.”
With materials and foods, we often use the
word, ‘piece’.
For example, “I ate two pieces of cake.”
Or bread.
Or pizza.
Or meat.
Or cheese.
“I need pieces of paper.”
Wood.
Plastic.
Metal.
Or “I have some water.”
‘Some’ is an article that always works
with uncountable nouns.
Ok guys, I hope you understand.
Let’s move on.
Some words can be both countable and uncountable
nouns.
Now not all of them.
But some of them.
Let’s take a look.
“I would like to eat some cake.”
“I would like two pieces of cake.”
So in these two sentences, ‘cake’ is obviously
and uncountable noun.
But if I say, “I would like to eat two cakes.”
Suddenly, it becomes a countable noun.
Why?
Because in the first two sentences, we are
talking about pieces of one cake.
In the last sentence, we are considering the
whole cake.
So it becomes countable.
Another example.
“I would like to eat some chicken.”
“I would like to eat a piece of chicken.”
Both sentences, uncountable noun, ‘chicken’.
But the last sentence, “I see two chickens.”
Hmm, ‘chicken’, in this case, is a countable
noun.
Why?
Because in the first two sentences, ‘chicken’
is food.
But in the last sentence, ‘chicken’ is
an animal.
So the animal is a countable noun.
‘Chicken’ as food is uncountable.
Hope you get it.
Let’s move on to example sentences now.
Let’s now review a few example sentences,
so you can practice using countable and uncountable
nouns.
Please repeat after me.
And be careful to use proper pronunciation.
Let’s get started.
First sentence guys.
“I put one hundred candles on six cakes.”
Please repeat after me.
“I put one hundred candles on six cakes.”
“I put one hundred candles on six cakes.”
Good job.
Second example.
“I ate two pieces of cake.”
Please repeat after me.
“I ate two pieces of cake.”
“I ate two pieces of cake.”
Next sentence.
“I saw some trash on all the streets.”
Please repeat after me.
“I saw some trash on all the streets.”
“I saw some trash on all the streets.”
Very good.
Next one.
“I need to buy some milk and some butter
from the market.”
Please repeat after me.
“I need to buy some milk and some butter
from the market.”
“I need to buy some milk and some butter
from the market.”
And finally.
“Traffic and pollution are problems in many
cities.”
Repeat after me.
“Traffic and pollution are problems in many
cities.”
“Traffic and pollution are problems in many
cities.”
Good job guys.
I hope you repeated after me and worked on
your pronunciation.
Thank you for watching this video.
I hope you now have a better understanding
of countable and uncountable nouns.
I know it’s hard, but don’t worry, keep
practicing.
Practice makes perfect.

Countable nouns are nouns that you can count.
Ok, so for example, if you say ‘a dog’,
you can say, “a dog, one dog, two dogs,
three dogs.”
You can count them.
Uncountable nouns…
Stop, you gotta slow down.
Ahh, sorry.
Why am I going so fast?
Slow down.
Take your time.
Make it a good video.
Okay.
Countable nouns are nouns that you can count.

hello everyone welcome to this English
course on adverbs and in this video
we're gonna talk about adverbs now the
simplest definition of an adverb is that
it's a word that describes or modifies a
verb now actually adverbs can modify
other parts of the sentence like other
adverbs but in this video we will focus
on verbs and four kinds of adverbs
adverbs of time adverse of place of
manner and adverbs of degree usually
they will answer the following questions
about the verbs when where how and to
what extent let's look at these
sentences the boy Ren and then we have
the boy Ren excitedly now this example
shows the power of adverbs in the second
sentence you find out how the boy ran in
the first sentence you don't have any
information on how the boy Ren so in the
second sentence we find out that the boy
was very excited so it's very important
to understand adverbs and understand how
to use them because they will make you
speak English a lot better so let's get
started first let's talk about the
position of an adverb so where do we put
the adverb in sentence now that is a bit
tricky because the adverb in an English
sentence can be in different parts of
sentence let's look at a few examples
she climbed the mountain slowly slowly
she climbed the mountain she
slowly climbs to the mountain can you
guess which word is the adverb the word
slowly is the adverb it described how
she climbed the mountain and as you can
see the adverb is in three different
parts of the sentence but the meaning is
exactly the same let's now talk about
how to make adverbs
now most adverbs not all of them but
most of them end in L Y so it's actually
very easy you take the adjective and you
add L y at the end let's look at a few
examples if you have the adjective nice
and you add ly to it you make the adverb
nicely so for example you could say he
is a nice speaker using the adjective
nice but you could also use the adverb
nicely and say he speaks nicely a second
example if we take the adjective quick
and we add ly we can make the adverb
quickly so we could say he is a quick
runner but we could also say he runs
quickly be careful guys not all adverbs
end in ly some adjectives don't change
form when they become adverbs they're
called flat adverbs typical flat adverbs
would be early or late and a few others
and it's very important to know these
flat adverbs because a lot of my
students try to add ly to some
adjectives and unfortunately they make
incorrect sentences so let's take a look
at an example
okay if I tell you the car drove fastly
do you think that makes sense now it
does make sense to try to add ly to the
adjective fast but unfortunately guys
fastly does not exist in English so the
correct sentence is the car drove fast
another example he arrived late or
lately to class what do you think's two
correct answer again it makes sense to
try to add ly to the adjective late but
lately is not the adverb of the
adjective late the adverb is late so the
correct sentence is he arrived late to
class let's now take a look at a few
sentences to practice finding and making
adverbs that modify verbs
now remember adverbs tell us so much
about the verb usually they tell us when
or where or how or to what degree so the
first example we have is he easily
lifted the box can you spot the adverb
in this sentence of course the adverb is
easily ending in ly okay and it tells us
how he lifted the box it's an adverb of
manner
now the second sentence and this is a
bit more difficult I will download the
file tomorrow now where is the adverb
because there is no word ending in ly so
it's a bit more complicated
well the adverb is tomorrow and it tells
you when it's an adverb of time and
these are sometimes a bit more difficult
make sure you watch my next video
I will talk about them our third example
now I put it there again
no words ending in ly the adverb is the
word there and it tells us where it's an
adverb of place we will talk about them
in our next videos as well and our last
example you didn't study enough for the
test the adverb is the word enough and
it's an adverb of degree okay it tells
us to what degree again it's not a word
ending in ly and we will talk about
adverbs of degree in our next videos
remember guys it's very important to
understand adverbs and to know how to
make them they will make you speak
English so much better and this video
was only a quick introduction to adverbs
in English in our next videos we will
focus on each kind of adverbs so make
sure you watch the rest of the course

hello everyone welcome to this English
course on adverbs and in this video I'm
gonna focus on adverbs of time now
adverbs of time
tell us when an action happens and also
how long and how often
now these adverbs are extremely common
in English so you really need to know
about them so let's start learning
together let's now take a look at a few
examples sentences telling us when
something happened
she ate ice cream yesterday the adverb
in this sentence is how you noticed
yesterday of course and it's an adverb
of time when did you eat ice-cream
yesterday I see you now now where is the
adverb in this sentence of course the
adverb is now again it's an adverb of
time when do I see you now I tell him
daily the adverb is daily again adverb
of time we met last year can you see the
adverb of course the adverb in this case
is last year again notion of time when
did we meet last year and finally he
will call you later
the adverb in this sentence is also an
adverb of time it is later so these are
all adverbs of time and as you can see
in those examples usually adverbs of
time are at the end of the sentence
let's now move on to example sentences
showing us how long something happened
these
adverbs are also usually placed at the
end of the sentence but let's have a
look she stayed home all day which part
of this sentence is an adverb can you
see it of course all day and it tells us
how long she stayed home I studied in
Canada for a year now in this sentence
for a year
tells us how long I studied in Canada he
has taught English since 1990 how long
has he taught English since 1990 I
studied English for four hours which
pond is the adverb for four hours how
long did I study English for four hours
and finally we have lived in New Zealand
since 2005 the adverb is of course since
2005 as you can see adverbs are not
necessarily just one word okay
since 2005 two words for four hours
three words okay so they're not just one
word sometimes they're more than one
adverbs telling us how often Express the
frequency of an action they're usually
placed before the main verb but after
the auxiliary verb such as be may have
or must the only exception is if the
main verb is the verb to be in which
case the adverb goes after the main verb
let's have a look at a few example
sentences I often eat pizza can you spot
the adverb
it's often and as you can see it is
placed before the main verb which is eat
so I often eat the second example he has
never drunk Cola in this case we have an
auxiliary verb the auxiliary verb have
and the main verb is drunk so the adverb
is placed between the auxiliary verb and
the main verb he has never drunk
you must always brush your teeth same
rule applies we have an auxiliary verb
must okay and we have the main verb
brush so the adverb goes after the
axillary verb but before the main verb
you must always brush I am seldom late
so the main verb is the verb to be be
careful so in this case the adverb goes
after the main verb I am seldom late and
finally he rarely lies the main verb is
lies
so the adverb goes before the main verb
he rarely lies okay some adverbs
expressing how often express the exact
number of times that an action happened
they're called definite adverbs of
frequency and in this case they're
usually placed at the end of the
sentence let's have a look at a few
examples I visit my dentist yearly the
adverb is yearly okay once a year and it
expresses the exact number of times that
I visit my dentist it's a definite
adverb of frequency so it's placed at
the end of the sentence other example he
goes to the gym once a week
again we have a definite adverb of
frequency which is once a week I work
five days a week same thing we have a
definite adverb of frequency which is
five days a week so it's placed at the
end of the sentence and finally I saw
the movie five times again five times
expresses the exact number of times that
I saw the movie now if you want to use
more than one adverb of time in a
sentence you should put them in the
following order first how long second
how often and finally when let's take a
look at a very good example sentence he
taught at the school for ten days every
month last year
now as you can see first we're told how
long for ten days then we're told how
often every month and finally were told
when exactly last year this is a very
good sentence using the different kinds
of adverbs of time in the right order so
I hope you can do the same okay guys
let's do a bit of extra practice I have
for example sentences for you to spot
adverbs of time so let's get started
he has been to Canada three times can
you spot the adverb of course the adverb
is the adverb of frequency three times
okay
how often has he been to Canada three
times the second example is generally I
don't like to eat spicy food the adverb
is generally and remember I told you
some adverbs of frequency
work well at the beginning of a sentence
if you want to emphasize the frequency
so generally is one of them another
example would be sometimes next example
he will clean his room regularly from
now on now be careful in this case we
have two adverbs the first one regularly
the second one from now on keeping the
order regularly is how often followed by
when from now on and finally I've been
going to church for four days every
month since 1996 three adverbs in this
case how long for four days how often
every month when since 1996
okay guys you now know a lot more about
adverbs of time remember these adverbs
are extremely common in English so it's
very important for you to learn about
them they will improve your English
skills very quickly okay now there are
obviously other types of adverbs adverbs
of place of manner and of degree and I
will focus on these in my next videos so
check them out

hello everyone welcome to this English
course on adverbs in this video we're
gonna talk about adverbs of place
adverbs of place
tell us where an action happens they
could also give us information on
direction distance or movement let's
take a look at a quick example let's go
and play outdoors now in this sentence
the adverb of place is outdoors it
answers the question where where
outdoors
okay now let's learn a bit more about
adverbs of place together let's get
started first let's talk a bit about
here and there here and there are two
adverbs of place that relates
specifically to the speaker here meaning
close to the speaker close to me there
meaning farther away okay let's take a
look at a few examples I put my keys
there so the adverb they're indicating
the location of the keys and they're a
bit farther away from me okay second
example please come here here being the
adverb you know meaning to me so these
adverbs are placed at the end of the
sentence but you can also put them at
the beginning if you want to emphasize
their location for example here are your
keys here close to me
there is your umbrella over there
away so in these two cases I want to
emphasize the location so I place the
adverb at the beginning of the sentence
okay guys let's now take a look at
adverbs of movement and directions
some adverbs and in ward88 it's the same
thing and they express movement in a
particular direction for example
homeward or homewards backward or
backwards forward or forwards on word or
on words so they express a movement and
they specify a particular direction
let's take a look at a few examples
sentences we drove East woods or
eastward it would be the exact same
thing the children looked upwards at the
stars you need to move forward
one step two each time you have a
movement specifying the direction of
this movement okay some adverbs express
both movement and location at the same
time for example when I say the child
went indoors there's a movement the
child goes into the house but it's also
a location he's inside
indoors another example would be he's
going abroad it's a movement but it's
also a location abroad in another
country finally I could say the rock
rolled downhill does the movement going
down but it's also a location everywhere
somewhere anywhere
or nowhere are adverbs of place as well
but they are special because they
describe a location or direction that is
indefinite or unspecific for example I
looked everywhere
for my car keys I'd like to go somewhere
for my vacation we're going nowhere
is there anywhere to get a coffee just
so you know some adverbs can also be
prepositions now the difference is that
an adverb stands alone a preposition is
always followed by a noun so for example
outside outside can be an adverb for
example we were waiting outside it's an
adverb it stands alone but it can also
be a preposition for example we were
waiting outside his office goes with a
noun another example I kicked the ball
around around is an adverb in this case
it stands alone but it can also be a
preposition I kicked the ball around the
field it goes with a noun okay so an
adverb stands alone a preposition is
followed by a noun okay guys let's do a
bit of extra practice I have a few
example sentences for you to spot
adverbs earth place first example John
looked around but he couldn't find his
wife now remember adverbs of place
answer the question where can you spot
the adverb here of course is the word
around where the John look he looked
around second example
I searched everywhere I could think of
now where did I searched everywhere
everywhere is the adverb let's go back
now what's the adverb in this sentence
it's back of course
we're back next example come in
we're in ok the adverb is in okay so
adverbs are placed answer the question
where okay guys you now know a lot more
about adverbs of place now I know it's
hard to learn about all these adverbs
but don't worry you'll get there you
just need a bit of practice okay now I'm
gonna carry on talking about adverbs in
my next videos so make sure to watch
them thank you for watching and see you

hello everyone and welcome to this
English course on adverbs in this video
I'm gonna talk to you about adverbs of
degree adverbs of degree tell us about
the intensity of something the power of
something now in English they're usually
placed before the adjective or adverb or
verb the D modify but obviously as
always there are exceptions and there
are very common adverbs of degree that
I'm sure you use all the time too enough
very extremely but there are so many
others
okay so let's dive into it and learn
about adverbs of degree let's have a
look and a few examples of adverbs of
degree especially how they are used with
adjectives adverbs and verbs
now adverbs of degree are usually placed
before the adjectives and adverbs that
they modify and before the main verb of
the sentence for example in the sentence
the water was extremely cold
you have the adjective cold and the
adverb extremely that modifies the
adjective cold and as you can see the
adverb is placed before the adjective
that it modifies second example he just
left
in this case the adverb just comes
before the verb left which is the main
verb of the sentence she is running very
fast now in this case we have two
adverbs
the adverb fast and the adverb very that
modifies the adverb fast and as you can
see our adverb very is placed before the
adverb that it modifies and finally they
are completely exhausted from the trip
the adverb completely modifies the
adjective exhausted and is therefore
placed before it I hope you understand
guys let's move on some very common
adverbs of degree in English are enough
very and - let's look at a few examples
is your coffee hot enough so in this
case our adverb enough modifies the
adjective hot he didn't work hard enough
in that case our adverb enough modifies
another adverb the adverb hard and as
you can see the adverb enough is usually
placed after the adjective or adverb
that it modifies another example is very
the girl was very beautiful
so the adverb very modifies our
adjective beautiful he worked very
quickly so in this case our adverb very
modifies the adverb quickly and as you
can see the very is usually placed
before the word that it modifies and
finally our third example is - this
coffee is too hot it modifies the
adjective hot he works too hard in that
case - modifies the adverb hard and as
you can see - is usually placed before
the word that it modifies
okay hope you got it let's move on okay
guys let's do a little bit of extra
practice with a few example sentences he
speaks very quickly can you spot the
adverb of degree it's very and it
modifies the other adverb of the
sentence
quickly he speaks too quickly now
another very common adverb of degree to
be very careful there's a difference
between very and to the very is a fact
to means there's a problem okay he
speaks so quickly that you cannot
understand
he speaks too quickly another example my
teacher is terribly angry where is the
adverb of degree
it's the adverb terribly that modifies
the adjective angry they were almost
finished can you spot the adverb it's
almost and it modifies the verb finished
okay so we're not finished yet we're
almost finished
and finally this box isn't big enough
the adverb of degree in this case is the
adverb enough and it modifies our
adjective big and remember enough
usually goes after the work that it
modifies okay I hope you get it guys
okay guys that you now know a lot more
about adverbs of degree and I'm sure
this video will help you improve your
English but keep practicing and make
sure you watch the other videos on
adverbs they're very useful as well

all your friends see you hello everyone
welcome to this English course on
adverbs in today's video I'm gonna talk
to you about adverbs of manner adverbs
of manner tell you how something happens
and they're usually placed after the
main verb or after its object let's take
a look at a few sentences he swims well
the adverb well tells you how he swims
and is placed after the main verb swims
he plays the piano beautifully the
adverb beautifully tells you how he
plays the piano and is placed after the
piano which is the object of the verb to
play hope you get it let's get into more
detail now adverbs of manner are usually
placed after the main verb or after the
objects for example he left the room
quickly
the adverb quickly is placed after the
object the room now just so you know
some adverbs not all of them but some
adverbs can also be placed before the
verb so in this case you can also say he
quickly left the room what's very
important for you to know
is that an adverb of manner cannot come
between a verb and its direct object
okay so it must be placed either before
the main verb or after at the end of the
clause so let's take a look at a few
examples
he ate quickly his dinner now this
sentence is incorrect okay
8 is the verb his dinner it's the direct
object of the verb so the adverb quickly
cannot be placed between those two okay
so you should say he ate his dinner
quickly the adverb is at the end and
that's correct
oh he quickly ate his dinner that's also
correct the adverb is placed before the
main verb
another example he gave me gently a hug
now this is incorrect you cannot
separate the verb giv from its direct
object a hug so two correct sentences
would be first he gave me a hug gently
with the adverb at the end of the
sentence or he gently gave me a hug
the adverb comes before the verb hope
you get it
time now to practice here are a few
example sentences for you to spot the
adverbs of manner he swam well as you
can see we use the adverb well it tells
you how he swam and it's placed after
the main verb swim the rain fell hard
again our adverb hard tells you how the
rain fell and is placed after the verb
the children were playing happily the
adverb is can you find it happily as
course she angrily slammed the door can
you see the adverb
it's angrily how did she slam the door
angrily and finally slowly she picked up
the flower can you spot the adverb of
manner it's slowly and it's at the
beginning of the sentence because we
want to emphasize the manner and this is
also something very common when you read
books ok guys that's it for this video
please make sure you watch the other
videos on adverbs and keep practicing
adverbs are extremely common in English
and they will make you speak a lot
better thanks for watching and see you
next time so be very careful when you
use quite because depending on the
adjective that you choose it has a
different meaning let's move on good you
have to say quite X as an intensifier
it is a mitigator but we use quite it
means absolutely ok
okay I feel guilty every time I have to
stop or tell you oh it's fine
mitigators are the opposite of
intensifiers thank you so much guys for

hello everyone and welcome to this
English course in today's video I'm
going to tell you about nouns because in
English nouns are very important they
are the basic element of a sentence so
if you want to speak English you need to
know about the different kinds of notes
and I'm going to try and teach you as
well as I can
let's get started okay so let's start
with concrete nouns now in English
concrete nouns are people places or
things including animals that you can
see that you can smell or taste or hear
or touch so you can basically use your
five senses
let me give you a few examples if we
talk about people you could say a man or
a teacher oh me funny
Oh mr. Smith if we talk about places you
could say a house a school you could
name a city like London very nice city
or a beach and if you talk about things
you could say a shoe you could say a
marker you could talk about a dog or
food like a pizza these are concrete
nouns okay now let's move on to abstract
nouns so abstract nouns
unlike concrete nouns our ideas concepts
emotions and you can't see an idea you
can't smell a concept you can't taste an
emotion or hear it or touch it so they
are nouns they are things that exist but
you cannot see them or taste them you
can't use your five senses to give you a
few examples we could talk about love
time or religion rules these are all
words that represent ideas concepts okay
they're abstract nouns in English now
let's get into more detail about nouns
let's now see the difference between
common nouns and proper nouns which are
very important in English so common
nouns and proper nouns refer to people
places things ideas let's see a few
examples we could talk about people for
example a woman that's a common now but
if we talk about a specific woman for
example me honey
that becomes a proper noun with a
capital F because and you should know
this proper nouns are always capitalized
you could talk about places a city
that's a common noun but then you can
name a specific city let's take a great
city London of course with a capital L
remember proper nouns always capitalized
we can talk about things for example an
animal let's take a dog a dog that's a
common noun but if we take a specific
dog like Snoopy capital S that's the
proper noun if we talk about things
again but for example a car that's a
common noun but if we name the brand a
specific brand of the car like a Volvo
that's a proper noun and it takes a
capital v and finally and we can say a
team common noun but if we name a
specific team for example the best
football team Manchester United
then that's a proper noun and it's
capitalized now mind you team is a
special word because it's called a
collective noun in English because it
refers to a group of people so
collective nouns can be used as singular
nouns or plural nouns but we will talk
about this again later so now that we
know a lot about nouns in English let's
practice finding nouns in a sentence
first in my class at Oxford University I
have many friends my best friend is Jen
I have a lot of love for her jen has a
cute dog
it's name is juju what are the nouns in
these sentences if we take the first
sentence in my class at Oxford
University I have many friends we have
class and friends these are common nouns
we also have a proper noun Oxford
University we know it's a proper noun
because it's capitalized
the second sentence is my best friend is
Jen now in this sentence the noun is
friend common noun
and there's also the word Jen is also a
noun but a proper noun as you can see
it's capitalized
then I have a lot of love for her
what noun can you see of course love
remember the abstract now and we talked
about a few minutes ago
and finally John has a cute dog it's
name is juju what nouns can we find we
can see Jen again proper noun dog
common noun but also name and juju names
a common noun juju is the proper noun
it's capitalized
as you probably know I haven't mentioned
I or her or it
they are also nouns but they are
pronouns and they're considered a
different category in English we will
talk about them in another video great
job guys thank you for watching my video
I hope you now have a better
understanding of nouns in English please
keep practicing practice makes perfect
I'm sure you will very soon be able to
recognize nouns in a sentence please
make sure to watch my next video as I
keep on talking about nouns do you thank
you for watching my video guys if you've
liked this video please click like

support put your comments below and
share this video thank you hello guys
and welcome to this English course on
nouns in today's video we're going to
talk about singular and plural nouns
when you speak English it is very
important to know the difference between
a singular noun and a plural noun okay
so I will explain to you the different
rules and we will practice together
let's get started okay guys the first
thing you need to know is that a
singular noun means one so for example I
can say cats a cat or one cat school a
school one school
team now don't forget team is a
collective noun it's a group of people
but still it is a singular noun we talk
about a team or one team lady monkey
tomato tomato
one tomato or piano now if we talk about
plural nouns it means more than one so
for example two three four or many
if we take our words again a cat becomes
cats two cats three cats many cats
school becomes schools
team becomes teams
okay so you just add an S now lady
becomes lady's monkey becomes monkeys
but two different rules
as you can see lady is consonant why
knowing you have consonant Y in an
English word the plural will be I e s
lady ladies but when you have vowel Y
like monkey
it just becomes monkeys you simply add
an S okay monkey becomes monkeys tomato
becomes tomatoes piano pianos again two
different rules now tomato becomes
tomatoes you add e s and with most words
ending in O so consonant oh you will add
es but sometimes you will only add s
like piano pianos there is no particular
rule for this you just need to know the
words that only end with an S we have
three different sounds
the
first sound is the second sound is and a
third sound is is so let's review some
words together and be really careful
what sound do you hear
cats cats what can you hear
can you repeat after me cats
cats
the second word is schools
schools
what sound can you hear of course repeat
after me
schools schools
the third word is teams
what sound can you again repeat after me
teens

then we have ladies ladies repeat after
me

again repeat after me
monkeys monkeys
then we have tomatoes again is the sound
Tomatoes
tomatoes
and finally pianos
pianos pianos
let's move on to other rules now okay
guys let's now talk about nouns that end
in s sh x CH / Zed
now to make the plural form of these
nouns you will add e s and the sound
will be is let's review some words
together
bus becomes buses
bush bushes fox foxes
each Beaches quiz quizzes can you repeat
after me
cease
buses
bushes

beaches

let's move on okay guys moving on to
nouns ending in F F II for example roof
becomes roofs safe safes so you simply
add an S then we have leaf that becomes
leaves wait a minute what happened well
yeah sometimes in English a word ending
in F becomes a word ending in ves in
plural that's not a rule but some words
end in ves you just have to learn them
on phrase another word wife and again
ves wives
shelf shelves again this ves ending can
you repeat after me roofs
Rufe
good job safes
safes

ending in a they're plural form will end
in a II for example antenna becomes and
Tenny
alumna alumna
words ending in u.s. US will end in I
octopus octopi cactus cacti words ending
in I s will end an e s this becomes ease
for example analysis analyses
diagnosis diagnosis and finally words
ending in O n and in a criterion

mistakes so don't worry too much about
them I just wanted to give you a little
taste of Latin and Greek plurals okay
let's move on to example sentences now
okay guys I have a few example sentences
for you it's a great opportunity to
practice saying irregular plural forms

you very much see you hello guys welcome
back to this english course on nouns in
today's video i'm going to tell you
about compound nouns they are very
common in English and there are
thousands of them you need to know about
them let's get started a compound noun
is made up of two different words so you
take two words you put them together to
create a new noun they're usually quite
easy to understand for example full-moon
4 is obviously the adjective describing
the moon
let's take a look at other examples and
how to create compound nouns sometimes
compound nouns are a single noun like
toothpaste sometimes there are two or
more words hyphenated such as
mother-in-law and sometimes there are
two separate words like ice cream
now you have to be careful sometimes you
have a simple adjective plus a noun like
a greenhouse but you also have a
compound noun which has a different
meaning a greenhouse now a green house
is a house which is green but the
compound noun a green house is a place
where you grow plants completely
different meaning okay so you have to be
careful stresses can help usually the
stress is on the first syllable in
compound nouns
okay I hope you get it guys let's and
take a closer look now at compound nouns
okay let's now take a look at the parts
of speech that make up a compound noun
we can have a noun and another noun like
bedroom we can also have a noun and a
verb like haircut
a noun and a preposition like passerby
a verb and a noun like washing machine
a verb and a preposition like drawback
a preposition and a noun like
underground an adjective and a verb like
dry cleaning an adjective and a noun
like software
a preposition and a verb like input
as you can see guys there are so many
ways to create compound nouns with
different words now let's get back to
our examples for pronunciation please
repeat after me
bedroom
bedroom
haircuts
haircut
passerby
passerby
washing machine
washing machine
drawback
drawback
underground
underground
dry-cleaning
dry-cleaning
software
software
input
input
good job guys let's now move on to
plural compound nouns so when we want to
make compound nouns plural there are
rules to follow
if you have a single word you simply add
an S but if you have separate words
whether hyphenated or not you will make
the most significant word plural
let's take a look at examples
newspaper will simply be newspapers so I
have many newspapers
swimming pool now what's the most
significant word well it is pool so we
will say there are two swimming pools
you cannot say there are two swimming
pools no s swimming
brother-in-law what's the most
significant word of course it is brother
so you will say I have two
brothers-in-law
and finally woman doctor now what's the
most significant word actually both
words are significant so we will both
make them sorrel remember the plural
form of woman is women so we will say
for women doctors work at the hospital
can you repeat after me please
I have many newspapers
I have many newspapers
there are two swimming pools
there are two swimming pools
I have two brothers-in-law
I have two brothers-in-law
and finally for women doctors work at
the hospital
for women doctors work at the hospital
good job guys now let's move on to
practice to practice I have a few
sentences and I want you to tell me if
we are using compound nouns or not
let's take a look
I want to drink some cold water
is called water a compound noun what do
you think
it isn't cold is a simple adjective
describing the water
she has a new boyfriend his boyfriend a
compound Nell well it isn't in this case
he's your friend
and he's a boy but the compound noun
boyfriend in one word exists and has a
different meaning then your boyfriend is
more than friend he's the boy you're
having a relationship with
other example
bird were singing in the tree his
Bluebird a compound man
not in this case it's a simple bird and
it's blue but the compound noun blue
bird in one word exists
it's a specific boat
let's meet at the bus stop
bus stop a compound now what do you
think
it is and finally I have two alarms
clock
what about alarms clock well it is a
compound noun but there is a big mistake
can you see it
course the plural form the plural form
is not alarms clock but alarm clocks
because the most significant word is
clock okay guys let's move on thank you
for watching I hope you better
understand of compound nouns and how to
create them there are so many compound
nouns in the English language but they
are usually very easy to understand and
if you're not sure look it up in a
dictionary the dictionary will tell you
if it's a compound noun or not thank you
for watching guys and see you in the
next videos thank you for watching my

hello guys welcome back to this English
course on nouns in this video I'm going
to tell you about countable and
uncountable nouns it's very important to
know the difference between countable
and uncountable nouns in English and
students often get confused so please
listen to me very carefully
let's get started countable nouns are
nouns that you can count
uncountable nouns are nouns that you
cannot count they're usually a type or a
group and they're always singular let's
look at a few examples
countable nouns you can say a dog you
can say one dog two dogs three dogs and
so on man you can say a man two men idea
you can say one idea two ideas and so on
computer again you can say one computer
to computers and house well you can say
one house two houses three houses and so
on these are countable nouns you can
count them but if we look at uncountable
nouns when you say water you can't say
one water two waters it doesn't make any
sense you cannot count water same goes
for air you can say one air 2 airs it's
just air its uncountable
traffic English equipment these are all
uncountable nouns you cannot count them
and they're always singular
okay guys now let's take a closer look
at rules with countable nouns and
uncountable nouns so how do we know if a
word is countable or uncountable well
there are a few tricks that can help
let's look at these words some groups of
words are very often uncountable and
this can help you
for example liquids water juice milk
beer all those words are uncountable
powders sugar flour salt rice
uncountable words as well materials such
as wood plastic metal or paper food as
well like fruit meat cheese and bread
and finally abstract ideas like time
information love and beauty another
trick is that most of the time you can
measure uncountable nouns let's look at
examples
example if we take liquids I have two
liters of milk now you cannot count milk
but you can measure milk and you can
count liters so you can say I have two
liters of milk you can say I have a
glass of water
or I have glasses of water cups a coffee
bottles of water so you can measure this
uncountable noun same goes with powders
I have one kilogram of sugar two
kilograms of sugar
with materials and foods we often use
the word peace for example I ate two
pieces of cake or bread or pizza or meat
or cheese
I need pieces of paper wood plastic
metal
or I have some water some is an article
that always works with uncountable nouns
okay guys I hope you understand let's
move on some words can be both countable
and uncountable nouns now not all of
them but some of them let's take a look
I would like to eat some cake
I would like two pieces of cake so in
these two sentences cake is obviously an
uncountable noun
what if I say I would like to eat two
cakes suddenly it becomes a countable
now why because in the first two
sentences we are talking about pieces of
one cake in the lungs sentence we are
considering the whole cake so it becomes
countable
another example I would like to eat some
chicken I would like to eat a piece of
chicken both sentences uncountable noun
chicken but the last sentence I see two
chickens hmm chicken in this case is a
countable noun why
cuz in the first two sentences chicken
is food but in the last sentence chicken
is an animal so the animal is a
countable noun
chicken is food is uncountable hope you
get it let's move on to example
sentences now let's now review a few
example sentences so you can practice
using countable and uncountable nouns
first sentence guys I put 100 candles on
6 cakes please repeat after me
I put 100 candles on 6 cakes
I put 100 candles on six cakes
good job second example I ate two pieces
of cake repeat after me
I ate two pieces of cake
I ate two pieces of cake
next sentence I saw some
trash on all the streets
repeat after me I saw some trash on all
the streets
I saw some trash on all the streets
very good next one I need to buy some
milk and some butter from the market
please repeat after me I need to buy
some milk and some butter from the
market
I need to buy some milk and some butter
from the market
and finally traffic and pollution are
problems in many cities repeat after me
traffic and pollution are problems in
many cities
traffic and pollution problems in many
cities
good job guys thank you for watching

understanding of countable and
uncountable nouns I know it's hard but

Hello, guys.
And welcome to this English course on adjectives.
In today’s video, I’m going to tell you
everything there is to know about adjectives.
And what they are exactly.
The best way to describe an adjective in English
is to say that
it’s a word that describes or clarifies
a noun.
It gives you information on people, things,
ideas, nouns, or pronouns.
It is very important to understand what adjectives
are
and to know how to use them.
Because they are essential when you speak
English.
Let’s get started.
Adjectives give us so much information about
nouns.
Let’s, for example, take a common noun,
‘cup’.
And see how many ways there are in English
to describe a cup
using different kinds of adjectives.
Let’s see.
We can say, “It’s a great cup.”
Just give your opinion.
“It’s a big cup.” Talking about the
size of the cup.
If you want to talk about the shape of the
cup you could say,
“It’s a round cup.”
“It’s an old cup.”
If you want to talk about age.
Or if you want to say what color it is,
“It’s a white cup.”
Or talking about temperature,
“It’s a cold cup.”
“It’s a broken cup.” If you make observations.
“It’s a Korean cup.” Talking about origins.
Or you can mention the material.
“It’s a plastic cup.”
Or “It’s a coffee cup.” Talking about
the purpose of the cup.
Now ‘coffee’ as you know is a noun.
But in this case, it can be used as an adjective.
All these adjectives are places before the
noun.
Let’s learn more about adjectives.
Adjectives can found before the noun.
It’s called the attribute position.
Or after the noun.
Which is called the predicative position.
And it’s just as common.
Adjectives which are found after a verb, describe
the subject of this verb.
Usually a noun or a pronoun.
So if we take the sentence, “The girl is
nice.”
The adjective, ‘nice’, refers to the subject
of the sentence, ‘the girl’.
But it is placed after the verb ‘to be’.
“My students are happy.”
Same thing.
The adjective, ‘happy’, describes the
subject of the sentence, ‘my students’.
But it is placed after the verb.
I hope you understand guys.
Let’s move on to practice now.
Let’s now practice finding adjectives in
a few sentences.
“I’m a tall woman.”
Can you see the adjective in this sentence?
I hope you can.
The adjective is ‘tall’.
It gives you the height of the woman.
“I’m a British woman.”
Now where is the adjective?
The adjective is ‘British’.
Gives you the origins of this woman.
“I have blonde hair.”
Now what’s the adjective in this sentence?
Of course guys, it is ‘blonde’.
It gives you the color of the hair.
“My eyes are blue.”
Now that’s a different sentence.
Can you spot the adjective?
The adjective is ‘blue.
What’s blue?
My eyes.
‘My eyes’ is the subject of the sentence
and the adjective is ‘blue’.
“I’m nice.”
Again, can you spot the adjective?
It’s ‘nice’.
Okay?
And finally,
“The weather is cold.”
What’s the adjective?
Where is it?
Can you see it?
The adjective is ‘cold’.
What’s cold?
The weather.
‘The weather’ is the subject and the adjective
is ‘cold’.
Now in the first three sentences, it’s the
attribute position.
Remember?
The adjective comes before the noun.
And in the last three sentences, it’s the
predicative position.
Remember?
The adjective comes after the noun.
And in this case, after the verb ‘to be’.
I hope you understand this.
Good job.
Okay, guys.
Let’s go through the sentences again.
This time focusing on pronunciation.
It’s very important that you repeat the
sentences after me
to practice saying these adjectives in a sentence.
Okay, let’s get started.
“I’m a tall woman.”
Can you repeat after me?
Twice.
First, “I’m a tall woman.”
“I’m a tall woman.”
Very good.
Moving on.
“I’m a British woman.”
Repeat after me.
“I’m a British woman.”
“I’m a British woman.”
Good.
Third sentence
“I have blonde hair.”
So repeat after me please.
“I have blonde hair.”
“I have blonde hair.”
Very good.
“My eyes are blue.”
Repeat after me.
“My eyes are blue.”
“My eyes are blue.”
Next one.
“I’m nice.”
Repeat after me.
“I’m nice.”
“I’m nice.”
Good job.

“The weather is cold.”
Please repeat.

Hello, guys.
Welcome to this English course on adjectives.
In today’s video, I’m going to talk about
prefixes and suffixes that are commonly added
to adjectives in English.
A prefix is a few letters added to a beginning
of a word to change the meaning of that word.
And a suffix is a few letters added to the
end of the word to change the meaning.
We’ll get more into detail.
Let’s get started.
Let’s take a look at a few adjectives with
prefixes.
Again a ‘prefix’ is a few letters added
to the beginning of the adjective.
Mostly to make it negative.
Let’s take a look at a few examples.
First we have the prefix ‘un’. U, n.
For example, if we take the word, ‘fair’,
and want to make it negative, we can add u
– n to have the word ‘unfair’ which
is the opposite of fair.
Same goes for ‘happy’.
‘unhappy’
‘sure’ become ‘unsure’.
Another prefix is i –n , ‘in’.
To make the adjective negative, again,
For example, ‘active’ – ‘inactive’.
‘appropriate’
’inappropriate’
‘complete’
‘incomplete’
The prefix i –r now, ‘ir’.
For example,
‘responsible’
‘irresponsible’
‘regular’
‘irregular’
‘rational’
‘irrational’
Then we have the prefix i –m, ‘im’.
For example,
‘balance’
‘imbalance’
‘polite’
‘impolite’
‘possible’
‘impossible’
And finally, the prefix, ‘il’.
I – l.
Like, ‘legal’
‘illegal’
‘literate’
‘illiterate’
‘logical’
‘illogical’
These are just a few examples, guys.
There are so many other prefixes in English.
But I hope you now have a better understanding.
Let’s move on.
Let’s now talk about suffixes.
In English, you can add a few letters to a
noun or a verb to make it into an adjective.
Not necessarily a negative adjective.
It’s not like prefixes.
There are so many suffixes in English, but
here is a list of very common ones.
We can find a suffix ‘able’.
Like, ‘adorable’.
‘comfortable’
Also the suffix ‘en’, e – n.
Like, ‘broken’.
‘golden’
‘ese’
Like, ‘Chinese’.
‘Japanese’
‘ful’
Like, ‘wonderful’.
‘powerful’
‘ative’
Like, ‘informative’.
‘talkative’
‘ous’
‘dangerous’
‘enormous’
Or ‘some’.
Like, ‘awesome’.
‘handsome’
Again, these are just a few examples.
There are so many suffixes.
But I hope you now have a good idea of how
to use suffixes in English.
Let’s now move on to practice.
Okay, guys.
Let’s practice finding adjectives in the
following sentences.
And prefixes or suffixes.
Let’s have a look.
“I have an uncomfortable seat.”
Now, can you spot the adjective, first?
Of course, the adjective here is ‘uncomfortable’.
Can you see any prefix or suffix?
I do.
There is a prefix, which is ‘un’.
And there is a suffix as well.
The suffix, ‘able’.
Okay, so look at how we transformed the word.
The first word was ‘comfort’ in English.
First, we added a suffix to make it into an
adjective, which is ‘comfortable’.
And then we added a prefix, ‘un’, to make
it negative.
So the seat is not comfortable, it is uncomfortable.
That’s how prefixes and suffixes can be
used in English.
The second sentence, “She has a black car.”
Can you spot the adjective, first.
Of course, it’s the adjective ‘black’.
Is there a suffix or a prefix?
No, there isn’t.
Next sentence.
“His father was unhelpful.”
What’s the adjective?
‘unhelpful’
Of course.
Any prefix, suffix?
Yes, there is a prefix.
Again, which is ‘un’.
To make the adjective negative.
And there is a suffix, ‘ful’.
To make the noun ‘help’ into an adjective.
‘unhelpful’
Next sentence.
“The actor is handsome.”
The adjective, of course, is ‘handsome’.
Is there a prefix? No, there isn’t.
Is there a suffix?
Of course, ‘some’.
‘handsome’
“I hate oily food.”
The adjective is ‘oily’.
Of course.
Is there a prefix?
There isn’t.
Is there a suffix?
Of course.
The ‘y’ is a suffix.
You have the word, the noun, ‘oil’.
And to make it into an adjective you add the
suffix ‘y’.
And finally,
“She is a dishonest woman.”
The adjective is ‘dishonest’, of course.
Do you have a prefix?
We do. Yes.
We have the prefix, ‘dis’.
It shows this woman is not honest, she is
dishonest.
Okay, so that’s how with prefixes and suffixes
we can really transform words in English.
It’s wonderful isn’t it?
There are thousands of prefixes and suffixes.
Again, these are just a few examples.
But I hope you now understand how it works
in English and how you can really transform
and play with the different words and kinds
of words.
Okay, guys. Let’s now review the sentences
together and focus on pronunciation.
Repeat after me, please.
“I have an uncomfortable seat.”
“I have an uncomfortable seat.”
Good job.
Second sentence.
“She has a black car.”
“She has a black car.”
Good.
Keep repeating.
“His father was unhelpful.”
“His father was unhelpful.”
“The actor is handsome.”
“The actor is handsome.”
Good.
Moving on.
“I hate oily food.”
“I hate oily food.”
And finally.
“She is a dishonest woman.”
“She is a dishonest woman.”
Excellent guys.
Okay, guys.
Thank you for watching this video.
I hoped this helped you understand a bit more
about prefixes and suffixes in English.
Keep practicing.
It takes practice to get better identifying
prefixes and suffixes, but I’m sure you
can do it.
Make sure you watch the video as I continue
talking about adjectives in English.

Hello guys and welcome to this English course
on adjectives.
In this video, I will be talking to you about
adjectives ending in ‘ed’ or ‘ing’.
These adjectives are very common in English
and they often confuse students and learners
in general.
So please be really careful. Listen very carefully.
Repeat after me.
Try and understand what the difference is.
Let's get started
Adjectives ending in ‘ed’, describe a
person's feeling.
For example, ‘bored’.
‘I am bored.’
Adjectives ending in ‘ing’ describe a
situation or an event.
For example, ‘boring’.
Let's take a sentence.
‘This film is boring.’
Ok that's the event.
It's boring.
And because the film is boring, I am bored.
That's my feeling.
I hope you get it.
Let's get a few more common examples.
For example, ‘annoyed’ and ‘annoying’.
‘He is annoyed’.
That's a feeling.
‘The noise is annoying’.
You're now describing the noise.
Other example, ‘confused’, ‘confusing’.
‘The student was confused’.
‘The English was confusing’.
‘depressed’
‘depressing’
‘My mom was depressed’.
‘She watched a depressing TV drama’.
‘excited’
‘exciting’
‘I'm excited.’
‘Travelling is exciting.’
‘frustrated’
‘frustrating’
‘My dog is frustrated.’
‘Staying home all day is frustrating.’
‘frightened’
‘frightening’
‘My little sister is frightened of the dark.’
‘A dark room is frightening.’
‘satisfied’
‘satisfying’
‘My dad is satisfied.’
‘He has a satisfying job’.
‘shocked’
‘shocking’
‘We were shocked by the accident.’
‘It was a shocking accident’.
‘interested’
‘interesting’
‘I'm interested in articles.’
‘I'm reading an interesting article’.
Last example, two sentences, two different
meanings.
Look at these:
‘The teacher was bored.’
‘The teacher was boring.’
Now you really have to understand the difference
between those two
because the meaning is not the same at all.
When you say ‘the teacher was bored’,
you are describing the teacher’s feeling.
Okay, that's how the teacher felt at that
time.
He or she was bored.
But when you say ‘the teacher was boring’,
you are describing the teacher.
Okay, the teacher made the students feel bored
because he or she was boring.
Okay, so remember ‘ed’ is for feelings.
And ‘ing’ is to describe events, things,
situations.
Okay let's move on to practice now.
I now have a few example sentences for you.
Let's have a look together.
‘Wow I am excited or exciting about my new
car’
Now what’s the correct answer?
What do you think?
Now remember ‘ed’ to talk about feelings.
‘ing’ to describe things.
In this case, are you talking about your feelings
or are you describing your new car.
Of course you are talking about your feelings.
So ‘Wow I'm excited about my new car.’
Second example:
‘Try not to get bored or boring when you
study English.’
Now what do you think are you talking about
feelings are you describing things?
Of course, again, we're talking about feelings
in this sentence.
‘Try not to get bored when you study English.’
Then, ‘Math is confused or confusing to
me.’?
Do you know the answer?
You are describing math to you.
It is confusing to you.
So math is confusing to me.
‘It was a thrilled or thrilling rollercoaster
ride.’?
Now in this case, if you think for a minute,
can a roller-coaster ride feel anything?
No it can't.
So it's obviously a description.
It was a thrilling rollercoaster ride.
And finally:
‘My mother is disappointed or disappointing
in my English score’.?
Of course you are talking about your mother's
feeling.
She is disappointed in your English score.
Very well guys.
I hope you did well and I hope you understand
the difference between ‘ed’ adjectives
and ‘ing’ adjectives.
Let's now review the sentences together and
focus on pronunciation.
Now listen very carefully and repeat after
me please.
‘Wow, I am excited about my new car.’
‘Wow, I am excited about my new car.’
Good.
‘Try not to get bored when you study English.’
‘Try not to get bored when you study English.’
Good guys.
Third sentence.
‘Math is confusing to me.’
‘Math is confusing to me.’
Very good.
‘It was a thrilling roller coaster ride.’
‘It was a thrilling roller coaster ride.’
Very nice.
And finally:
‘My mother is disappointed in my English
score.’
One last time.
‘My mother is disappointed in my English
score.’
Good job guys.
Okay students.
Thank you for watching.
I hope you understood the difference between
adjectives ending in ‘ed’ and ‘ing’.
They are very important as they will allow
you to describe how you feel and to
describe things and events and situations.
Please keep practicing as this is still a
common mistakes among students.
So the more you practice, the better you'll
get.
Thank you very much.

Hello guys and welcome to this English course
on adjectives.
In this video, I'm gonna talk to you about
adjectives order
in a sentence using more than one
adjective to modify a noun.
Now this is a very important topic
because if you use more than one
adjective to modify a noun,
you have to follow a specific order, so you
need to keep watching.
Let's get started.
Let's take a look at this
adjective order.
It looks like a lot at first, but you will
learn very fast and practice will help.
Let's have a look together.
First, we will use the adjectives describing
quality or giving your opinion.
Like delicious, beautiful, or good.
Then, we will talk about size.
Adjectives like tall, short, big.
Then comes age.
Like old, young, new, twenty-year-old.
Then comes shape. Adjectives like
round, or square.
Then color - red, green, blue.
Origin - like Korean, Mexican, or
American.
Material - like glass, gold, or wooden.
And finally, purpose adjectives
like sport or coffee.
Remember my cup from the first video?
Well we could say -
it's a great big old round white Korean plastic
cup.
So a great - giving my opinion.
big - the size.
old - the age.
round - for the shape .
white - the color.
Korean - for the
origins.
plastic - the material.
That's the adjective order. I cannot break
it. I have to follow it.
Don't worry guys.
Most of the time you will only use one maybe
two or three adjectives in one sentence.
But still you have to follow this order.
Let's now look together at a few sentences
with multiple adjectives.
For example, these beautiful young girls went
to school.
First, how many adjectives do you see in that
sentence?
I see two adjectives beautiful and young.
The order is beautiful - your opinion.
And then, 'young' for age.
Second example.
I have dirty old running shoes.
How many adjectives can you see?
There are three.
Dirty - your opinion.
Old -the age
And running - which is a purpose
adjectives.
Then we have - that's a hot green Korean pepper.
How many adjectives?
There are three adjectives.
Hot - your opinion.
Green - the colour.
Korean - the origins.
And finally, Canada is a nice large country.
Two adjectives.
Nice - for your opinion.
And large - for the size.
Let's now review the
sentences together for pronunciation.
Please repeat after me.
These beautiful young girls went to school.
These beautiful young girls went to school.
I have dirty old running shoes.
I have dirty old running shoes.
Good.
That's a hot green Korean pepper.
That's a hot green Korean pepper.
Very nice. And finally,
Canada is a nice large country.
Canada is a nice large country.
Good job guys.
Let's now move on to more practice.
Okay guys you are experts now.
Time to move on to some extra practice.
I have sentences for you - some of them
are correct - some of them are not.
And it's up to you to tell me.
Let's have a look.
She is a tall British woman.
Now how many adjectives can you see in
this sentence?
I see two adjectives.
And is the order correct?
Tall - is the size.
British - the origins.
So it is correct. Yes.
Size comes before origins.
She is a tall British woman.
I have a red big ball.
How many adjectives?
Two.
And is the order correct?
Red is the color
and big is the size.
Well no it isn't.
It should be - I have a big red ball.
Size comes before color.
I got a gold new watch.
Again, I suppose you know - two adjectives.
Gold for the material.
and new for the age.
And age comes before material so it should
be
I got a new gold watch.
My mother has red long hair.
We have two adjectives.
Red for the colour.
And long - the size.
And size comes before color so it should be,
My mother has a long red hair.
And finally,
this is a cute little white puppy.
Three adjectives.
Is the order correct?
what do you think?
Well it is correct.
We have 'cute' for your opinion. '
'little' for the size.
'white' for the color.
And the order is correct.
This is a cute little white puppy
Okay guys.
Thank you for watching this video.
I hope this helped you understand adjective
order.
This is not that difficult.
My students learn this order very quickly
and I'm sure you will, too.
That's it for this video. I hope to see you
in the next one. Bye.

Hello students and welcome back to my English
course on adjectives.
In this video, I'm going to talk to you about
intensifiers and mitigators.
Now what are those?
Don't be scared of their names.
Intensifiers are simply words that will make
adjectives stronger.
They will give adjectives more power or more
emphasis.
For example, two very common intensifiers
in English are ‘really’ and ‘very’.
Mitigators on the other hand, make the adjectives
weaker like the words brother or family.
But we're gonna go into a little more detail.
Keep watching.
Let's start with intensifiers.
And I have a list of intensifies for you.
Of course these are not all of them, but it's
a good start because they are very common
in English.
Let's have a look.
really
This video is really interesting.
The adjectives in this sentence is interesting
and we make it stronger with the intensifier,
‘really’.
It's really interesting.
very
For example, I'm very happy to learn English.
The adjective is ‘happy’.
And we give it more power with the intensifier.
very
I am very happy to learn English.
Other intensifiers include absolutely.
or example your new dress is absolutely amazing.
‘extremely’
Like
‘It's extremely cold outside.”
‘incredibly’
For example, ‘Your son is incredibly smart.’
‘completely’
‘My wallet is completely empty.’
unusually
‘The classroom was unusually quiet.’
And finally, ‘enough’.
‘He isn't old enough to drive.’
Now for this last sentence, the adjective
is old and II intensifier is enough.
It's a special case because as you can hear
and see, ‘enough’ always comes after the
adjective.
Intensifiers are commonly used with comparative
and superlative adjectives.
For example, with comparative adjectives,
we offer news much.
For example, ‘He runs much faster than me.’
‘Faster’ is the comparative form of the
adjective ‘fast’.
And to intensify the comparison, we use the
intensifier ‘much’.
So he runs much faster than me.
We also use ‘a lot’.
For example, ‘This red bag is a lot heavier
than this white bag’.
‘heavier’ is the comparative form of the
adjective ‘heavy’.
And we make it even more powerful with ‘a
lot heavier’.
And we also use ‘fun’.
For example, ‘She is far taller than me’.
‘taller’ is the comparative of ‘tall’.
We make it more powerful with ‘far’.
‘Far taller than me’.
Now with superlative adjectives, we can use
‘easily’.
For example, ‘This is easily the best restaurant
in town’.
‘best’ is the superlative form of the
adjective ‘good’.
And we make it even more powerful by saying,
‘easily the best restaurant’.
And we also use ‘by far’.
For example, ‘Sarah is by far the smartest
girl in class’.
Let's move on to mitigators.
Now mitigators are the opposite of intensifiers.
They weaken the adjectives.
Let's look at a few examples.
Mitigators include ‘fairly’.
For example, ‘It's fairly sunny today’.
The adjective ‘sunny’ is weakened by the
mitigator ‘fairly’.
So it's not sunny it's a bit less than sunny.
Other mitigator ‘rather’.
So when I say, ‘I'm rather tired’,
I'm not exactly tired.
I'm a bit less.
The adjective is less powerful because of
this ‘rather’.
Other example, ‘pretty’.
‘It's pretty expensive’.
Which means it's not expensive.
It's a little bit less.
Oh quite like, ‘The movie was quite good’.
The adjective ‘good’ is less powerful
because of this ‘quite’.
Now be very careful because if you use ‘quite’
with an extreme adjective such as ‘terrible’,
‘perfect’, ‘enormous’, or ‘excellent’
–
quite means ‘absolutely’.
It becomes an intensifier.
For example, ‘She is quite gorgeous.’
Means she is absolutely gorgeous.
It's more powerful because of the intensified
‘quite’.
So be very careful when you use ‘quite’
because depending on the adjective that you
choose it has a different meaning.
And it can be either an intensifier or a mitigator.
Let's move on.
Just as intensifiers, mitigators can be used
with comparative adjectives.
Let's look at a few examples.
We can use ‘a bit’.
For example, ‘He's a bit faster than me’.
When you say, “He's a bit faster than me,”
it's
less powerful than “He's faster than me.”
So ‘a bit’ it's mitigates it weakens ‘faster’.
Same goes for ‘rather’.
For example, ‘This dress is rather nicer
than that dress’.
It weakens the comparison the nicer.
Third case we can say ‘a little bit’.
For example, ‘There's a little bit more
rain today than yesterday’.
It's less powerful then.
There's more rain.
And finally we can say, ‘slightly’.
For example, ‘My car is slightly older than
your car’.
So it's just a little bit older than your
car.
It's weak because of this mitigator.
Let's now move on to practice.
I want things to be very clear so I have a
few example sentences for you guys.
And I want you to tell me if you see an intensifier
or a mitigator.
Let's have a look first.
‘It's a very interesting game’.
Now what's the adjective in that sentence?
‘interesting’ of course.
What about ‘very’.
Is it an intensifier or a mitigator?
What do you think?
It's an intensifier of course.
It's a very interesting game.
It's more powerful thanks to this ‘very’.
The second sentence, ‘She cooks fairly good
pasta’.
Now the adjective in this sentence is ‘good’.
I'm sure you know what about ‘fairly’.
Is it an intensifier or a mitigator?
It's a mitigator guys.
The adjective ‘good’ is less powerful
because of ‘fairly’.
‘She cooks fairly good pasta’.
The third example,
‘He's quite brilliant at speaking English’.
The adjective is ‘brilliant’.
Now just a hint.
It's an extreme adjective.
‘brilliant’ is a very strong adjective,
so what about ‘quite’?
Is it an intensifier or a mitigator?
It is an intensifier of course because the
adjective is extreme.
I hope you got that.
Next example.
‘She's a bit younger than I am’.
The adjective is actually a comparative adjective.
In this sentence, ‘younger’ a bit acts
as a mitigator of course.
And finally, ‘My dog is much fatter than
my cat’.
Again, it's a comparative adjective ‘fatter’.
And what about ‘much’?
What do you think?
Intensifier, mitigator?
It's an intensifier.
It's much fatter than my cat.
Good job guys.
Let's move on.
Let's go through the sentences again and focus
on pronunciation.
Please repeat after me.
It's a very interesting game.
One more time.
It's a very interesting game.
Good.
Second example.
She cooks fairly good pasta.
She cooks fairly good pasta.
Third example guys.
He's quite brilliant at speaking English.
One more time.
He's quite brilliant at speaking English.
Moving on.
She's a bit younger than I am.
She's a bit younger than I am.
And finally, my dog is much fatter than my
cat.
My dog is much fatter than my cat.
Excellent guys.
Thank you guys for watching the video.
I hope this has helped.
Now using intensifiers and mitigators takes
practice.
A lot of practice.
But I'm sure you can do it and it's worth
it.
It will make a true difference to your speaking
skills.
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
